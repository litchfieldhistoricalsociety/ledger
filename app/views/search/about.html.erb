<h1 class="page_header">About the Ledger</h1>
<p class="explanatory_text">
Litchfield Connecticut holds a position of unique importance in the early history of America, and the Litchfield Historical Society has long
held an incomparable collection of biographical information, manuscripts, and artifacts related to the two educational institutions that called
Litchfield home. Until now, though, researchers needed to travel to Connecticut to take advantage of this material.
</p>
<p class="explanatory_text">
With the advance of online resources and the increased availability of funding to make primary sources available online, the staff of the
Historical Society conceived of The Ledger as a way to enhance knowledge about the Female Academy and Law School through encouraging
new scholarship focused on these institutions and their students. This virtual collection brings together sources that are held in Litchfield
with many others from across the country the country in various repositories and private hands.
