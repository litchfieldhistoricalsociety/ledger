An army officer, chief intelligence officer, and organizer of the Culper spy ring during the Revolutionary War, Tallmadge became a businessman and U.S. Representative from Connecticut in Congress after the war.

The collection contains Tallmadge's duplicate original letters to George Washington concerning military operations and Tallmadge's operations of the secret service during the Revolutionary War. These letters record not only detailed summaries of battles, movements of troops, and requests for provisions, but also the activities of spies and communications of their intelligence. Many of the letters are written in cipher. Also included are two original letters from Washington to Tallmadge concerning military administration.

The letters also record Tallmadge's business activities after the war, especially in his correspondence with his son-in-law, John Paine Cushman, a lawyer in New York and, from 1817-1819, U. S. Representative of New York in Congress, whose advice and assistance Tallmadge frequently sought for his financial transactions.

In addition, legal documents, accounts, and bills and receipts illuminate Tallmadge's business ventures, especially his purchases and sales of land in Vermont, New York, Massachusetts, and Ohio, with references to the Ohio Company and Western Reserve. Other items include accounts for Tallmadge's store in Litchfield, Connecticut; receipts documenting his investment in privateering ships; and bills of sale for the purchase of slaves.

Moreover, his letters to Cushman reveal their opinions on national politics and government, especially during Cushman's own service in Congress. Meanwhile, his letters to his daughter, Maria (Tallmadge) Cushman, document the religious revival movement in New England, in which Tallmadge took great interest, describing the activities of such revivalist preachers as Lyman Beecher, Asahel Nettleton, and Nathan Beman. These letters also provide insight into the social and personal activities of the Tallmadge and Cushman families in Litchfield and elsewhere. Occasionally, the letters are appended by notes to Maria from Tallmadge's second wife, Maria (Hallett) Tallmadge.

The collection also contains correspondence and business papers of Tallmadge's son, Frederick Augustus Tallmadge, which primarily concern Frederick Tallmadge's publication of his father's memoirs. The Tallmadge children attended the Law School and Female Academy, and matters relating to both schools appear in the papers.","http://www.litchfieldhistoricalsociety.org/archon/?p=collections/controlcard&id=1",,

Dr. Josiah Gale Beckwith (1803-1871) was born in Standford, N. Y. After graduating from Union College, he studied medicine at the Albany Medical College and settled in Litchfield in 1829. He married Jane Maria Seymour (1811-1868) in 1831 and they had five children: Jane (1833-1837), Elizabeth (1835-1896), Josiah (1838-1911), Sarah (1840-1928), and George (1841-1890). Jane Seymour (1811-1868) was a daughter of Moses Seymour Jr. (1774-1826) of Litchfield. Dr. and Mrs. Beckwith resided in the house Mrs. Beckwith's father built in 1817 on South St. The house was occupied by succeeding generations of Beckwiths. Dr. Beckwith was a successful practitioner, officer of the state medical society, nominated for governor, and elected to the state legislature several times. He operated a drug store, invested in a variety of business interests, and served as an officer of several prominent local institutions, including terms as president of the Phoenix Bank and Litchfield Mutual Fire Insurance Co.

A son of Dr. Beckwith, Dr. Josiah Gale Beckwith (1838-1911) was born in Litchfield. He attended the U.S. Naval Academy for two years until resigning in 1855. He attended Union College, leaving in 1860, and also attended the Yale University Medical School in 1861 and 1862. In 1862, he volunteered with a local military company, but appears not to have served as a soldier during the Civil War. He was at the Knight United States Army General Hospital in New Haven for a time starting in 1862. He practiced medicine at Charlton, N.Y. from 1866 through 1869 and then returned to Litchfield. After his father's death in 1871, he took over the family drug store and continued with his medical practice. He married Anne Bonfield Alsop (Allsopp) (1851-1936) of Quebec, Canada, in 1873. They had three children: Josiah (1874-1957), Margaret (1885-1972), and Sutherland (1890-1986).

Josiah Gale Beckwith (1874-1957) was alternatively referred to in various combinations of Josiah Gale Beckwith Jr., J. Gale Beckwith, and Gael Beckwith. He was born in Litchfield and attended Union College and Albany Law School. He was briefly a lawyer in Waterbury in the early 1900s. In the 1910s he worked in New Jersey and Georgia and later moved to Minneapolis and St. Petersburg, Fla., where he died in an automobile accident.

Sutherland Alsop Beckwith (1890-1982) was born in Litchfield. He graduated from the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale University in 1915. He fought in the 1916 Mexican border conflict, WWI, and WWII. His military career spanned 35 years and he retired as a colonel. During the 1920s, he was involved in a lumber business operating under the name of Hubbard & Beckwith. Beckwith was a state adjutant general, a sheriff of Litchfield County, and a local director of the Works Progress Administration. For 10 years he served as Litchfield postmaster. He married Helen Cahill in 1925. After she died in 1929, he married Charlotte Louise Coopernail (1904-1986), daughter of Dr. George Coopernail (1876-1964), on July 30, 1932. They had three children: Ann (1934- ), Margaret (1936- ) and George (1938- ).

The Beckwith Family Collection contains a range of materials that relate to many of the family's activities. A small group of papers predates those of the Beckwith family. At present, only materials created prior to 1840, a limited selection of post-1840 materials, and those that relate to Josiah Beckwith (1803-1871) have been processed. They are arranged in three series.

Series 1, Papers (1767-1892), contains a collection of primarily legal and financial records which appear to have no direct connection to the Beckwith family.

Series 2, Beckwith family papers (1825-1871), primarily contains papers relating to Dr. Beckwith. Of note is his correspondence with his brother George in which he discusses business dealings and events of the day, his account books documenting the certificates of exemption he granted during the Civil War in 1862, records relating to business affairs, and his medical and drugstore ledgers. Also included in Series 2 are early records related to the Alsop (Allsopp) family.

Series 3, Seymour family papers (1814-1886), contains a small group of materials that relate to Jane Seymour Beckwith, her mother, Mabel Strong Seymour; her father, Moses Seymour Jr.; and her sister Delia Seymour.

A collection of bills, circa 1870-1920, directed to the Beckwith family arranged alphabetically by sender documents the types of goods and services offered by Litchfield county businesses and institutions and the consumption habits of the Beckwiths.

The unprocessed portion of the collection consists of about 15 cubic feet. Generally, it includes correspondence, account and ledger books, diaries and notebooks, photographs, architectural drawings and records related to the Beckwith Block, and other materials. The papers primarily document the second Dr. Beckwith, including his ledgers and account books, Ann Alsop Beckwith, Charlotte Coopernail Beckwith, Sutherland Beckwith, J. Gale Beckwith, and Margaret Beckwith (1885-1972, born in Litchfield, and who enjoyed a long career as a teacher). Other papers, to a lesser extent, relate to other Beckwith family members. There is also material that relates to members of the Seymour family, including George Seymour and Henry Seymour.

The collection also contains extensive genealogical information and family papers compiled by Dr. George Coopernail. A prominent physician in Bedford, N.Y., Coopernail was Sutherland Beckwith's father-in-law. After retiring, he moved to Litchfield and died there in 1964. He took an active interest in both his and the Beckwith lines. Among his papers are a series of albums containing family photographs.

The papers also include a small collection of correspondence and writings relating to Walter Ferriss, whose daughter married Canfield's son.

Judson Canfield was born in New Milford, Connecticut, January 23, 1759. He was a son of Col. Samuel Canfield (1725-1799), an officer in the Revolutionary army and a member of the Connecticut state legislature, and Elizabeth Judson. Judson Canfield was educated at Yale College, graduating in 1782. His uncle, John Canfield, the first lawyer in Sharon, Conn., died in 1786, and Judson then moved to Sharon and established a successful law practice. Many of his clients conducted business or resided in Dutchess County, New York.

In 1796, Canfield purchased land in the Western Reserve (later Ohio) from the Connecticut Land Co. His holdings would eventually total thousands of acres, including property in present-day Bainbridge, Canfield (which was named for him in 1800), Cleveland, Medina, Newton, and Newton Falls.

Canfield was elected to the Connecticut General Assembly from 1802 to 1809 and elected a State Senator from 1810 to 1815. From 1808 to 1815, he was also an associate judge of the county court for the county of Litchfield. In 1815, he moved to Ohio, devoting himself mainly to farming and disposing of his properties. He died February 5, 1840 in New York City.

In 1786, he married Mabel Ruggles (1761-1844). Their children were Henry Judson, Julia Elvira, Elizabeth Hannah, and Caroline Emma. Henry J. Canfield (1789-1856), graduated from Yale College in 1806, studied at the Litchfield Law School in 1808, and was admitted to the bar in 1810. He moved to Canfield, where he practiced law, farmed, raised sheep, and managed his father's land holdings. In 1825, he married Sally Ruth Ferris ( -1881), the daughter of Walter Ferriss (1768-1806) and Sarah (Sally) Morgan Ferriss (1772-1850). They had two children, Julia Elvira Canfield Ruggles (1826-1857) and Judson Walter Canfield. Walter Ferriss, from Oblong, Dutchess County, N.Y., moved to Charlotte, Vt., in 1792. At first, he concentrated on farming, but in the later 1790s he became a Universalist minister and organized several societies in the vicinity. He was appointed to the Committee of the General Convention in Strafford, Vermont, in 1802. In 1803, Ferris attended the Winchester Convention in New Hampshire as a representative from Hinesburg, Vermont.

All three of Judson and Mabel Ruggles Canfield's daughters attended the Litchfield Female Academy. Julia Elvira (1791-1868) married Samuel Flewwelling of New York City, a prominent banker who purchased land in Ohio from Judson Canfield, members of his family, and others. Elizabeth Hannah (1793-1878) married Frederick Augustus Tallmadge (1784-1869) of Litchfield, son of Col. Benjamin Tallmadge. Frederick was a prominent lawyer in New York City and held elective office. Caroline Emma (1798-1872) married William Mackay of New York City, a New York City commission merchant. William Mackay and Julia Canfield Flewwelling were executors of Judson Canfield's will.

Herman Canfield, brother of Judson Canfield, married Fetia Bostwick. In October, 1805, they settled in Canfield, Ohio.

The papers are arranged in two series. Series 1, Judson Canfield papers, primarily consists of documents related to Canfield's law practice. Most involve matters in and around Sharon, Conn., but there are several documents pertaining to land sales in Ohio. There is an interesting letter from Canfield's niece to her mother in which she describes a party she attended, what she and others wore; and news of her relatives in New York and Nyack, including the Bostwick, Flewwelling, Mackay, Ruggles, and Tallmadge families. Series 2, Walter Ferriss papers, includes two documents relating to his affections for his future wife and letters concerning his religious activities, including a letter he wrote to Universalist minister James Babbitt to explain why Ferriss is unable to comply with Babbitt's pressing invitation to him to go to Essex, Vt.","http://www.litchfieldhistoricalsociety.org/archon/?p=collections/controlcard&id=275",,

"Samuel Flewwelling papers","2010-96-0","Collections of Papers","Judson Canfield; Mabel Ruggles Canfield; Julia Canfield Flewwelling; Elizabeth Canfield Tallmadge; Caroline Canfield Mackay; Frederick Augustus Tallmadge","Litchfield, Connecticut; Canfield, Ohio; New York, New York","Samuel Flewwelling","1799-1868","Samuel Flewwelling Papers","Litchfield Historical Society",,"0.83 linear feet","The papers of New York City banker and businessman Samuel Flewwelling (1774 or 5-1849) primarily relating to property held by his wife, Julia Elvira Canfield Flewwelling (1791-1868), and him in the Western Reserve, later Ohio. Following Samuel's death, the properties were managed by William Mackay (1795-1873), a New York City businessman and the husband of Caroline Emma Canfield Mackay. The collections includes indentures, agreements, leases, deeds, statements and accounts, and correspondence.

Samuel Flewwelling was born in 1774 or 1775, a son of Abel Flewwelling and Abigail Fowler Flewwelling of Newburgh, N.Y. The Flewwellings moved to New Brunswick during or shortly after the American Revolution. Samuel became associated with William Rhinelander in New York in 1796 and joined the Manhattan Bank in 1801 as bookkeeper. He was promoted to more responsible positions, becoming cashier of the Poughkeepsie branch in 1809. In 1810, he returned to the main office to become cashier until 1817, when he became cashier of the City Bank. He was the cashier of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company from 1825 until 1829, when he became cashier of the National Bank in New York. Flewwelling maintained residences in New York City and Nyack, N.Y. He retired in 1840 and died in 1849.

Samuel Flewwelling married Julia Elvira Canfield, a daughter of Judson Canfield and Mabel Ruggles Canfield. Samuel and Julia Flewwelling had no children. Julia's siblings were Henry J. Canfield (1789-1856) of Canfield, Ohio; Elizabeth Hannah Canfield Tallmadge (1793-1878); and Caroline Emma Canfield Mackay (1798-1872).

The papers are arranged chronologically in one series and consist mostly of documents concerning the conveyance land in the Western Reserve. The earliest document outlines the partitioning of land Judson Canfield and others purchased from the Connecticut Land Co. in 1799. Flewwelling acquired land from Canfield as early as 1815. Some of the later sales were among members of Flewwelling's family, including his father-in-law Judson Canfield, his brother-in-law Henry J. Canfield, and his brother- and sister-in-law Frederick Augustus Tallmadge and Elizabeth Canfield Tallmadge. Flewwelling provided mortgages to some of the purchasers of land, and the agreements contained in the papers spell out the payment terms.

For many years, Royal Millard served as Flewwelling's agent in Ohio, and the collection includes many of his letters reporting on the buying and selling of properties and the collection of funds. After Millard died in 1854, Henry Canfield and William H. Canfield, a nephew of Judson Canfield, served as agents in Ohio, and their letters are also represented in the collection.

Following Flewwelling's death in 1849, his brother-in-law William Mackay, a New York City businessman whose father William and brother Robert Mackay were wealthy Boston merchants, managed the Ohio lands for Julia Canfield Flewwelling. It appears that by the time of Mrs. Flewwelling's death in 1868 all of her and her late husband's Ohio land holdings may have been sold.

Of particular interest in the papers are several documents that summarize Flewwelling's property holdings and detail the contracts and deeds he held.","http://www.litchfieldhistoricalsociety.org/archon/?p=collections/controlcard&id=284",,

The records were recovered from the attic of the former Westleigh Inn and it is not known why the records were stored there. They appear to complement the Litchfield County Court records held by the Connecticut State Archives. In the absence of original order, they have been arranged in two series, Case files and Subject files, using two State Archives finding aids as models: ""RG 003, Litchfield County, County Court Files, Inventory of Records"" and ""RG 003, Litchfield County, County Court Papers by Subject Inventory of Records,"" both of which were prepared by Debra Pond. The description of the series and records which follow include excerpts from these State Archives finding aids.

Series 1, Case files, contain original materials and relate to civil lawsuits and criminal actions in the years between 1790 and 1861. While the records relating to each file vary by case, common documents include writs, summonses, motions filed by the parties, and jury verdicts. The cases are arranged chronologically and then alphabetically by plaintiff.

Series 2, Subject files, include a range of records and generally follow the subject categories found in the Litchfield County Court records at the Connecticut State Archives. The categories are organized alphabetically, and then arranged chronologically within each category.

Subject file categories:

Admissions to the bar (1859-1860) contains chronologically arranged certificates from the county bar's committee of examiners reporting results of its examination of candidates seeking to be admitted to practice before the Litchfield County bar.

Appeals from probate (1800-1855) contains chronologically arranged documents from parties requesting reconsideration of probate court decisions.

Appointments of commissioners (1855-1860) contains chronologically arranged documents relating to confirmations of individuals sworn as commissioners of the court.

Costs (1798-1860, undated) are accountings of court costs from individual files for items such as service of writs, summoning of witnesses, juror expenses, sheriff's travel expenses and the like. Some cost records do not include the name of the case to which they belong. The records are filed chronologically by year.

Court expenses (1798-1859) are arranged chronologically and consist primarily of accounts by those incurring expenses in running the court. Entries include such items as dinner and wine expenses and some itemized gaoler accounts, which provide details of the care provided to prisoners while incarcerated in Litchfield.

Inquests (1798-1861) are investigations into the causes of suspicious deaths. They are arranged chronologically by year.

Jurors (circa 1800-1860) contains orders to town constables to summon jurors for jury duty, as the court needed them to try cases. In addition, the clerk's notes of the individuals who served on the jury for certain trials may be found here. These records are arranged first by general records, which include documents relating to county-wide matters, and second alphabetically by town name, then chronologically.

Justices by town (1860-1861) contains documents confirming the swearing of justices of the peace and are arranged alphabetically by town.

Miscellaneous (1802-circa 1930) contains a variety of material and generally consists of individual items. Documents include a land appraisal, a bond, a deposition apparently unrelated to any case file, documents relating to post-Civil War military pensions, photographs of two unidentified men circa 1930, and other items.

Naturalization (1842-1860) is made up of petitions for and other documents relating to naturalization. They are arranged chronologically and then by the name of the individual.

Protection Orders (1799-1812) protected debtors with a large number of debts from arrest while at court suing their own creditors. They are arranged chronologically.

Taverns (1856-1860) is composed of chronologically arranged certifications to the court of the tavern keepers appointed by the county's towns. Tavern licenses were appointed, or renewed, annually by the court.","http://www.litchfieldhistoricalsociety.org/archon/index.php?p=collections/controlcard&id=235",,

The collection documents events of national importance: John Pierce, a colonel and paymaster in the Continental Army, received letters from numerous correspondents concerning military, administrative, and political news of the American Revolution. Moreover, the Pierce brothers traveled extensively along the East Coast as well as in the South, and their letters provide a record of the industrial and social development, natural resources, and scenery of the major cities of the early American republic as well as contemporary opinions on the condition of slavery in America.

Since Timothy Pierce was a doctor, many of his letters illuminate medical practice during this time, including the difficulties of setting up a private practice and the realities of military medicine. Meanwhile, the letters to Sarah Pierce make references to her role as founder and teacher of the Litchfield Female Academy, a nationally prominent girls' school. The collection includes a letter to Pierce from Harriet Beecher Stowe praising her history textbook and requesting copies of it, correspondence about boarders for the school, and three silk diplomas.

Finally, the letters also shed light on social life in the early republic, as the Pierce brothers frequently attended parties, went on steamboat trips, advised their sisters on deportment, and discussed women's fashions with them.","http://www.litchfieldhistoricalsociety.org/archon/index.php?p=collections/controlcard&id=3",,

His law career is extensively represented in his business correspondence with clients concerning suits in progress and with other law professionals; his law school notebooks; and his own notes on pending lawsuits. These papers document the education and routine work of a lawyer in this period, as well as the networks among lawyers in New England and their relationships with judges, courts, and other members of the judicial system.

The collection also illuminates the central position of the postal service in the early republic through letters sent to Woodruff in his capacity as postmaster of Litchfield. These include not only correspondence with other postmasters concerning mail schedules and misdirected letters, but also correspondence from individuals from other towns seeking information about Litchfield inhabitants, reporting suspicious activities, and asking for assistance in publicizing their own careers.

Additionally, Woodruff's extensive personal correspondence with his family sheds light on his personal life, especially in letters to and from his brothers Lewis B. Woodruff, a lawyer in New York, and Reuben M. Woodruff, a physician. These letters record their efforts to establish and develop their careers, their travels along the east coast and the southern United States, and family and social news. Moreover, the collection includes Woodruff's personal papers, which trace his interest in genealogical research, the history of Litchfield, and his autobiographical efforts.

The collection follows Woodruff's political career through newspaper clippings and his own handwritten records of local and national election results, as well as documents his other business ventures, including investments in railroads, canals, and banks, and his involvement in the Litchfield Mutual Fire Insurance Company. By extension, these papers reveal political processes and economic developments during this time period.

Also present in this collection are the papers of numerous Woodruff relatives, as well as those of other prominent and lesser-known Litchfield families. For example, the collection documents the extensive land transactions executed by Woodruff's father, Morris Woodruff, especially in partnership with Simeon Harrison; the law career of his son George M. Woodruff; and his grandson James P. Woodruff's law and political careers. The collection also includes many personal and business papers from members of the Seymour and Wolcott families, as well as from the family of Henry E.

The following year, Sally's brother Aaron Burr came to live with them and Reeve began to instruct him in the law. Several prominent residents of Litchfield also sent their sons to Reeve for legal training, establishing his reputation as a teacher and forming the nucleus of what was to become America's first formal school of law.

As the number of students increased, Reeve began to develop a series of formal lectures that prepared
. . . [read more]

students to take the bar exam and practice law. In the years following the Revolution most lawyers taught through the apprenticeship system because there were no schools that offered law degrees. Reeve’s decision to pass on his legal knowledge through formal organized classes distinguished him from others who were training new lawyers. By 1784 the number of students enrolling outgrew the space in Reeve's parlor office, prompting Reeve to construct a one-room school building next to his house.

Through his lectures, Tapping Reeve sought to train his students in legal principles and their application to any legal situation. Reeve and his eventual partner James Gould, developed a detailed eighteen month course of lectures, covering every aspect of legal practice. Students took copious lecture notes that they then carefully re-copied and had bound into leather volumes. These volumes provided the Litchfield Law School graduates with the basis of their office law libraries. The students then used their bound notes as reference manuals for the rest of their careers.

Alumni of the Litchfield Law School had a tremendous impact on the development of the new nation, shaping the creation of the American legal and judicial systems, and profoundly influencing subsequent developments in legal education. Reeve's emphasis on a system of legal principles rather than local laws and statutes, his use of legal cases in teaching, his establishment of student moot courts, and his division of lectures into subjects, all shaped legal education as we know it today.

The Law School attracted over 1,200 students from 13 states and territories to study in Litchfield. Graduates formed a network of leadership and influence that encompassed public service, business, and other areas of American life. Ultimately, the small law school would educate two US vice-presidents (Aaron Burr and John C. Calhoun), as well as 14 governors, 14 members of the federal cabinet, 28 U.S. Senators, 100 members of the House of Representatives, three Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court, and many other state and local public officials.

This collection includes materials pertaining to Tapping Reeve, James Gould, the Litchfield Law School, and alumni of the school.  It was assembled by the Historical Society over a period of years.  The student images were originally collected for display on the walls of the Tapping Reeve House.  When the house was reinterpreted in 1998, the photos were relocated to the Litchfield Law School Collection.

Many of the published law books used by Reeve and his students are also held by the Society and can be found through the book catalog.  The Society's institutional records document the history of the Tapping Reeve House and Litchfield Law School building.  There is no known comprehensive collection of Tapping Reeve's personal or business papers though collections such as this contain examples of his correspondence and legal work.","http://www.litchfieldhistoricalsociety.org/archon/index.php?p=collections/findingaid&id=10&q=",,
