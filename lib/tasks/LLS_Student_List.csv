His mother, Abigial Whitney Bacon of Plainfield, Vermont, was his father's second wife.  Bacon attended several schools and academies in Canterbury and Windham before entering Yale College in 1789.  Bacon graduated from Yale with a distinguished record in 1793 and immediately afterward worked in the law office of General Cleveland in his native town of Canterbury.  After spending six months there, he enterd the Litchfield Law School and became prepared to enter the practice of law, and was admitted to the bar in Connecticut in 1795. Bacon then went to Virginia and was admitted to the bar only after great difficulty and expense, settling for three years in Leesburg, Virginia.  In 1798, Bacon returned to Canterbury and opened a law office. Bacon took on four students, three of whom were from Massachusetts, and all of whom went on to great distinction.  One became governor of that state, another was a judge on the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, and another became a Congressman from New York State.  After practicing law for seven years in Canterbury, Bacon was elected to the Connecticut House of Representatives in 1800. In 1803 he moved to Litchfield, Connecticut at the invitation of the Honorable John Allen to become his partner.  Due to his failing health, however, Allen retired in 1812.  During this time, Bacon married. His wife Lucretia Champion of East Haddam, Connecticut was the only daughter of Epaphroditus Champion, and her brother had attended the Law School in Litchfield in 1805. Asa and Lucretia had six children during their marriage.  Bacon attempted to continue his political career after his marriage without great success.  He ran for the United States Congresss and lost for ten consecutive years between 1806 and and 1816.  While Bacon did not succeeded in establishing a successful political career, he maintained a full legal practice until he was sixty years old.  In 1832, ""pneumoniac attacks"" forced him to retire from the  bar for he was unable to do public speaking.  Nevertheless, Bacon pursued a new career as the president of the Phoenix Branch Bank of Litchfield from 1833 to 1846. When his policies proved to be too  cautious for many shareholders he resigned from the position, sold his Litchfield property and moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 1851 where he lived until his death.

Henry first attended the Hopkins Grammar School in 1793 and then graduated from Yale College in 1797 when he was only eighteen years old.   He attended the Litchfield Law School in 1797 and then went to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where he studeid law for several months with the Honorable AIexander J. Dallas.  He was admitted to the Philadelphia bar on March 6, 1798.  In 1799, Baldwin started for Ohio to join his brother Michael and stopped in Pittsburgh, which in that year was a city with a population of 1500.  Baldwin married Marana Norton in May of 1802.  She was his third cousin and the daughter of Nathaniel Norton of Bloomfield, New York.  She died only one month after their only son was born.  After his first wife's death, Baldwin married Sally Ellicott of Lancaster, Pennsylvania on June 11, 1805.  She was the daughter of Major Andrew and Sally Brown Ellicott, and survived Baldwin with an adopted daughter.  Baldwin was admitted to the Allegheny County Bar on April 30, 1801 and was reported to have a practice that extended into all the counties west of the Allegheny River and into some parts of Ohio.  His law partners were Tarleton Bates of Virginia and Walter Forwards, and they were known as the ""Great Triumvirate of Early Pittsburgh"".  Together they bought the Republican newspaper The Tree of Liberty.  Baldwin also had mill interests in Pennsylvania and Ohio, especially the iron rolling and woolen mills.  Furthermore, Baldwin had a flourishing political career.  In 1816/1817, he was elected as a Democrat to Congress from Pennsylvania and drafted the tariff of 1820.  He wanted a protective tariff for goods produced within the United States, and earned a reputation within Congress as an ""economic nationalist"".  In addition, Baldwin was one of the only eighteen men from non-slave states who voted for the Missouri Compromise.  He opposed the passage of an anti-slavery proviso in the Missouri Compromise, for he hoped that by doing so he would gain the support of the Sourtherners for his 1820 bill to raise tariffs.  However, the Southerners in Congress did not rally behind his bill, and it lost in the Senate by one vote.  In 1822, Baldwin resigned from Congress due to poor health and was ill for the next two years.  Nevertheless, Baldwin returned that same year to his legal practice.  Baldwin had an extensive law library and was involved in many important cases.  In 1828, he supported Andrew Jackson for president, and was disappointed when he did not receive the promised post of Secretary of the Treasury.  However, in 1829, Baldwin was instead offered a place on the Supreme Court upon the death of Justice Bushrod Washington.  On January 4, 1830, President Jackson nominated Baldwin to the United States Supreme Court, and two days later his nomination was confirmed by the Senate.  Baldwin held his position as a Justice of the Supreme Court until his death in 1844. Notably , Bladwin often challenged the views of the Constitution held by Chief Justice Marshall and Justice Story.  In the term of 1831, he dissented seven times, whenever he believed the court to be encroaching on state powers.  Baldwin was also involved in several important cases during his time on the Supreme Court.  One case was U.S. v. Arrendono in 1832 which established the principle that land claims resting on acts of foreign governments had to be presumed valid unless the U.S. could prove otherwise.  In addition, in the case of Holmes v. Jennison in 1840, he upheld the right of a state to surrender fugitives to a foreign country even though this interfered with the power of the federal government in foreign affairs. He also stood against President Jackson during this attack on the Bank of the U.S.  Baldwin had upheld the legality of the actions of the bank, while the Secretary of the Treasury Roger Taney and President Jackson had opposed the recharting of the bank.  In 1833, he was confined to a hospital and missed the first court term of that year.  Baldwin wrote over forty majority opinions while on the Supreme Court, but as time passed fewer of these opinions were clear expositions of constitutinal doctrine.  He increasingly withdrew into paranoid isolation and dissented with little comprehensible reason.  Baldwin received his second honorary law degree from Jefferson College in Pennsylvania in 1843, but for the last four years of this life, Baldwin was reported to have a violent temper, and while there were doubts about his sanity there was no attempt made to remove him from the bench.  By 1844 he was deeply in debt, and he died on April 21, 1844 in Philadelphia from a stroke he had suffered a week earlier.

His father Simeon Baldwin was a prominent politician and judge in both New York and Connecticut.  His mother Rebecca Sherman died when he was only two years old on September 4, 1795, and his father remarried his mother's younger sister Elizabeth Sherman Burr, the widow of Sturges Burr of New York City.  Baldwin studied at the Hopkins Grammar School under his cousin Henry Sherman, and entered Yale College in 1807. He graduated from Yale in 1811  with honors when he was only eighteen years old.  Baldwin then entered the Litchfield Law School in 1812 following in the footsteps of his brother Ebenezer Baldwin, who had attended the Law School in 1810, when he was admitted to the bar in New Haven in 1814.  Since his father was then serving as a judge on the bench he began his law practice alone.  On October 25, 1820, Baldwin married Emily Perkins, the youngest daughter of Enoch Perkins of Hartford, a Yale classmate of his farther's.  They had nine children, and four of their surviving sons would atttend Yale. Like many law school graduates, Baldwin pursued a considerable political as well as legal career.  In 1826, Baldwin was elected to the City Common Council of New Haven.  From 1837 to 1838, he served as a member of the Whig Party in the State Senate, holding the office of president pro term in 1838.  Baldwin then served in the Connecticut State House of Representatives from 1841 to 1842.  One notable legal case in the career of Roger Sherman Baldwin was the Amistad case. Baldwin revealed his anti-slavery sentiments in this case, where he defended the slaves who had revolted on the schooner and were charged with murder and piracy.  He defended the case along with ex-president John Quincy Adams in front of the Supreme Court from 1839 to 1840.  In 1843, Baldwin ran as a Whig for governor and was defeated, but he launched a successful campaign in 1844, and was reelected in 1845.  During this same period, Baldwin received two honorary LLD's from Trinity College and Yale College.  In addition, from 1847 to 1851, Baldwin served as the United States Senator from Connecticut where he made many important speeches.   He spoke out against the Mexican War and its implications, particularly citing how the war had made possible the extension of slavery by the admission of California as a state.  In 1850, Baldwin also made a speech condemning the Fugitive Slave Law.  After leaving Congress in 1851, Baldwin resumed his legal practice which was reported to be more lucrative than that of any other lawyer in the state.  Baldwin again entered the political arena, when in 1860 he served as a Presidential Elector and voted for Abraham Lincoln.  In 1861, he went to the National Peace Convention in Washington as the delegate from Connecticut, and he prepared the Minority Report  for the Committee on Resolutions and supported Kentucky's application to Congresss to call a convention to propose amendments to the U.S. Constitiution.  Baldwin died in New Haven on February 19, 1863. ","Ledger. ""Journals of the Barr - Litchfield County.""

A letter from Sydney Thompson to Samuel Fisher (Samuel Fisher Collection Box 4, miscellaneous correspondence) relates the following: ""Mrs. Stoeckel says that Philp Battell was an odd member of her grandfather Battell's family of nine children.  He was very dreamy, poetic and unpractical, - always missing trains- always forgetting things- but courteous and charming in his mannters.  He was always writing affectionate letters to Mrs. Stockel which he began, in the manner of the English Royal Family, 'My dear Cousin!' He settled in Middlebury, Vermont, where he married the daughter of Judge Seymour, who must have had Litchfield antecedents.  He lived in the fine old Seymour house, which is stillowned by his descendants.  Mrs. Stoeckel remembers him as a handsome and charming old gentleman.  He lived to be over ninety, in full posession of his faculties.

Before attending the Litchfield Law School, Bell studied law with his brother Samuel D. Bell (later a judge of the Superior Court) of Concord, New Hampshire.  After preparing with his brother, Bell attended the Litchfield Law School in 1824.  Once his studies were completeed he returned to New Hampshire, where he passed the bar in 1825 and began to practice law in Gilmanton.  The rapid development of manufacturing in the Massachusetts towns of Lowell and Lawrence, and in Manchester, New Hampshire depended completely on the water power of the Merrimac River.  During the dry summer season, manufacturing was threatened by lack of water.  Plans were developed for an extensive system of dams and reservoirs of the New Hampshire lakes to feed the Merrimac.  These plans involved intricate legal problems in purchasing the necessary lands and rights.  Bell was appointed to negotiate between the small landowners of the lakes region of and the powerful mill companies as head of the Winnepesaukee Land and Waterpower Company.  His success in obtaining the riparian rights for the great manufacturing companies assured the continued growth of New England mills.  Bell was also involved in New Hampshire politics, twice running unsuccessfully for the governorship, and serving in the New Hampshire House of Representatives in 1846 and 1850.  In 1855, he was elected to the U.S. Senate.  He died in Laconia, New Hampshire in 1857. ","Catalogue of the Litchfield Law School (Hartford, CT: Press of Case, Tiffany and Company, 1848), 20.

Edwin grew up on his family farm and received a childhood and formative education, before attending the Litchfield Law School in 1827. After graduating, he entered the law office of Beers & Sanford, at Litchfield, reading law for two and one-half years and attending lectures at the law school of Judge Gould. Edwin suffered from health problems and he felt compelled to leave Connecticut.  In 1835, he moved to Sandusky, Ohio, to work in farming and agriculture.  Presumably, due to the Bradley Family's longstanding military service, Edwin applied to work with the military in Ohio.  At the beginning of the Mexican American war, he commenced recruiting a company of men for service. He lead this company to Camp Washington, where it was organized as Company F, with Bradley as Captian and they were assigned to the First Ohio Volunteer Infantry.  He commanded Company F until it was mustered out of service at New  Orleans, June, 1847. After the war with Mexico, Edwin became a mercantile trader in Williams County Ohio and moved to Stryker, Ohio in 1856. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Bradley recruited a Company that was attached to 14th Ohio Regiment.  During this period of service he was promoted to the rank of Colonel and, at the expiration of his Company's service, he raised soldiers to form the 38th Ohio Volunteer Regiment (known as the Williams County Regiment).  Due to failing health, Col. Bradley resigned in Feb. 1862.  He had been married three times, but his last wife was Kate Russel Bradley.  He had at least three sons; all were of age to serve, and took part in the Civil War.  ","Catalogue of the Litchfield Law School (Hartford, CT: Press of Case, Tiffany and Company, 1848), 22. ",,,,,,

After graduating from Yale, Bradley published an Atronomical Diary.  He taught school after graduation, while also attending the Litchfield Law School.  He then embarked on a military career.  In 1776, he commanded a brief term company of Cheshire volunteers and worked as an aide-de-camp the following year to General Wooster.

Bradley published Vermont's Appeal to the Candid and Impartial World to bolster Vemont's request for statehood in 1779.  Bradley was also an active member of the Commission which settled a dispute with New York State and consequently allowed Vermont to become the fourteenth state after the original thirteen colonies.  While campaigning for Vermont's statehood, Bradley remained active in the military.  In 1781, he was a colonel in the State Militia and in 1791 was a Brigadier in the General Milia.  He retired from the military with the rank of Colonel.  Bradley led an active political life was well.  While in the United States Senate, Bradley was considered a ""Republican of the School of Jefferson,"" yet he was against the War of 1812.  As a result of his opposition to the war, he withdrew from public life and later moved to Walpole, New Hampshire in 1818.

His grandfather, Robert Breckenridge was a Captain in the French and Indian War.  His father, also John Breckenridge, was an early settler of and prominent politician from Kentucky who had a county in the state named after him, and resided at their family home, ""Cabell's Dale."" His father died when he was only nine years old and his older brother became his guardian.  In 1818 he graduated from Princeton College after only three years of study. He then went on to study law at the Litchfield Law School. After completing his law studies however, Breckenridge became a minister despite considerable opposition from his family.  Even before his studies at the law school, Breckenridge had shown an interest in theology.  From 1819 to 1821, he had been both a tutor at Princeton and a student in the Theological Seminary.  On August 1, 1822, he was licensed to preach in New Brunswick, New Jersey and on September 10, 1823 he was ordained in Kentucky.  Breckenridge was a lifelong opponent of New School Presbyterianism and he held various ministries and office during his lifetime.  In 1826, he served for a short time as the minister of the Second Presbyterian Church in Baltimore, Maryland.  He also served as a minister in Lexington, Kentukcy and was famous for his religious debates published in the 1830s.  While in Lexington, he often spoke out against what he believed to be the liberalism of President Horace Holley of Transylvania University.  Breckenridge wanted to be a foreign missionary but poor health prevented him from doing so.  In 1831, he acted as the Secretary and General Agent of the Board of Education of the Presbyterian Church.  Breckenridge ventured into teaching in 1836 when he was appointed a Professor of Pastoral Theology at Princeton Seminary.  In 1838, he relinquished that office in order to become the Secretary and General Agent of the Board of Foreign Missions.  He acted in this position for two years until his health began to increasingly fail.  Breckenridge then accepted another ministry at the Presbyterian Church in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1840.  In 1841, he was chosen to be the President of Oglethorpe University in Georgia.  However, he died not long after while spending time at his Cabell's Dale estate in Lexington, Kentucky.

He quickly became a leading political figure in New York and served a year in the State Assembly from 1784 to 1785.  Rising fast, he soon became the Attorney General of New York from 1789 until 1790 and was then elected to the United States Senate, serving from 1791 to 1797.  Next, Burr opted to run against Thomas Jefferson for the Republican candidacy in the 1800 presidential election; during this race Burr tied Jefferson in votes.  The decision came down to the House of Representatives who voted him the Vice President under Jefferson.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Aaron Burr's life and reputation took a sharp turn towards infamy when, during his term as Vice President, he shot and killed Alexander Hamilton.  Although dueling was a common method of settling disputes at the time, it was illegal and participation was frowned upon by those serving in America's highest offices. Unfortunately, Burr's temper got the better of him and he confronted Hamilton (his longtime political enemy) and challenged him to a duel. It was on July 11, 1804 that Hamilton was killed on teh Palisades above Weehawken, NJ.  The public outcry for justice was immense and Burr was formally charged for murder in both New Jersey and the state of New York.  Yet, (presumably) due to serving in such a high office, he never faced trial in those states.  Still, many threats were leveled towards Burr and he was forced to retreat to South Carolina in the middle of his term, only to return to Washington weeks later in order to finish his Vice Presidency.

He was indicted by President Jefferson for treason; being accused of heading a complex conspiracy plot against the United States which claimed Burr was attempting to raise an army in order to take over a piece of Mexican territory now in an area of Texas. Once aquired, Burr would then rule over the land as a dictator of his own nation state.  This land actually included part of the U.S. owned Louisiana Purchase, which made seizing it (or plotting to do so) an act of treason.  Although Jefferson wanted a treason conviction, Burr was acquitted by Justice John Marshall due to a lack of evidence by the prosecution.  Burr's acquittal was a landmark ruling that upheld our Constitutional law, protecting the rights of citizens accused of treason.

He waited four years before returning to New York in 1812.  Burr praticed law for the remainder of his life and fell into relative obscurity until his death on Staten Island, New York on September 14, 1836.

After completing his legal training, Burrall opened a practice in Canaan and became active in local legal affairs of the railroad interests in the northwest portion of the state.  In 1838, he moved to Bridgeport, Connecticut to become President of the Housatonic Railroad, a position he held until 1853.  He also served on the boards of the New York and New Haven Railroad and the Illinois Central Railroad.  In 1853 he was named President of the later.  In 1856, he became Vice President of the New Haven and Hartford Railroad, and  became a legal expert on the negotiation of railroad contracts.  He played an instrumental role in the consolidation of the many small, early lines into major corporations.  Although busy, he also became President of the New Haven and Hartford Railroad, overseeing its consolidation into the New York, New Haven and Hartford  line, which was one of the country's major railroad companies.  After leading a full life Burrall passed away in Hartford, Connecticut. ","Catalogue of the Litchfield Law School (Hartford, CT: Press of Case, Tiffany and Company, 1848), 23. ",,,,"Haines, Selden.

Calhoun was born in South Carolina, March 18, 1782.  He spent his youth and formative education in South Carolina and moved north to attend Yale, graduating in 1804.  Calhoun then entered Litchfield Law School in 1805 and was admitted to the bar in 1807.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   He chose to return to South Carolina and was elected a member of the state house of representatives for a year 1808-1809, running as a Democratic Republican.  From 1811-1817 Calhoun was elected to Congress and eventually stepped down to look for a bigger political move.  President James Monroe appointed Calhoun the Secretary of War and he served the post from 1817-1825.  During this time, Calhoun didn't forget about Litchfield and (in 1820) he even took the time to write a letter of witness and he traveled to appear in court to support the pension claim of a Litchfield Revolutionary War veteran, Daniel Fenn. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Calhoun made his next bold political move in 1824, deciding to run in the presidential elections and he was elected Vice President of the United States under President John Quincy Adams.  Four years later, Calhoun was reelected Vice President of the United States (in 1828) under President Andrew Jackson, serving from March 4, 1825 to December 28, 1832.  Calhoun had to relegate his Vice Presidency, as he had been elected to fill a vacant spot in the US Senate in 1832.
  
Calhoun was reelected to the Sentate for a full decade, until stepping down on March 3, 1843. President John Tyler appointed Calhoun the Secretary of State from 1844-1845 but, once again, he was elected to fill a vacancy in the Senate.  He served in the Senate until his death in Washington, D.C. on March 31, 1850.

He owned a cotton plantation on the Savannah River and also owned a home in Lincolnton, that later became the Dozier Hotel.  William was a prosperous planter and by 1850 his real estate was valued at $17,500 and he owned 36 slaves.  In addition to being a landowner and planter, he was the founder of the Lincolnton Female Academy in 1836.  He died in his family home.  His widow, Lucinda, died there as well and they were both buried on the family plantation.  ","Catalogue of the Litchfield Law School (Hartford, CT: Press of Case, Tiffany and Company, 1849), 11.

His father later became a frontiersman and moved to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania where George was born in 1796.  George met trappers, hunters, explorers and settlers who stayed with his family on their travels west.  At age 17, George was sent to Litchfield to study law which he disliked.  George preferred to read about natural history, science, arts, Indians and to sketch fellow students and local scenery.

After two years of study in Litchfield, George entered the Bar of Luzerne County in Pennsylvania.  He practiced law for two years before he “resolved to convert my law library into paint pots and brushes.”  In 1823, Catlin studied art in Philadelphia and established himself as a popular portraitist in Washington, D.C. and Albany, NY.  After meeting a tribal delegation of Indians from the western frontier, Catlin became eager to preserve a record of Native American customs and individuals.

In 1830, George Catlin traveled to St. Louis where the explorer General William Clark helped him make contact with Native Peoples.  Catlin traveled for years in North and South America, painting and sketching hundreds of portraits, scenes of villages, religious rituals, games and Indians at work.  He stimulated an interest in the cultures of Native Peoples and he publicly exhibited his work in Europe and the United States.

George Catlin appealed to the U.S. government to purchase his collection to create a museum of the west in 1836.  In 1847, he asked Congress to include his work as part of a bill they were considering to establish the Smithsonian Institution.  However, the outbreak of the Mexican War caused Congress to deny the purchase.  In 1852, Massachusetts Senator Daniel Webster supported the purchase of Catlin’s collection calling it “more important than all the other drawings and representations on the face of the earth.”  The bill was defeated by one vote due to the lobbying of anti-Indian Southern Democrats.

Catlin’s entire work and life was motivated by his desire to obtain recognition for the dignity and highly developed cultures of Native Peoples and his deep interest in natural history.  His work was never purchased by Congress, but it was privately donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 1871.  Catlin also contributed to the knowledge of his era in 1844 by publishing Manners, Customs, and Conditions of the North American Indians, Catlin’s North American Indian Portfolio, My Life Among Indians (published in 1867) and Shut Your Mouth and Save Your Life  (published in 1891).

His father's parents were James and Sarah (Middleton) Clayton.  While Clayton was a boy his family moved to Milford, Kent County, DE.  He attended academies in Berlin, MD and Lewes and Milford, DE.  Clayton graduated from Yale with highest honors and during his junior year there had delivered an oration on ""Military Glory.""  After attending the law school and passing the bar, Clayton began a law practice in Dover, DE as well as a long and prominent career in the Delaware government.  

Clayton was elected the Clerk of the State House of Representatives of DE.  At first, due to ""family"" influence, he was a member of the Federalist Party but he later became a Whig.  During this time he married but his wife died in childbirth in 1825 and both of his sons would die unmarried.  On December 21, 1826, he was appointed the Secretary of State of Delaware by Governor Paynter.  Governor Polk reappointed him in that position until he resigned in 1828 to enter national politics.  He supported John Quincy Adams in the Presidential Campaign of 1828 and on March 4, 1829 he was elected to his first term in the U.S. Senate.  When he was elected, he was the youngest member of the U.S. Senate.  This was the beginning of Clayton's prominent federal political career.  

In 1830, he gave a powerful speech on Foot's resolution and was instrumental in leading the reform and reorganization of the Post Office.  During his first term as a Senator, he also supported President Jackson in his campaign against nullification but did not support his bank policies.  In February 1833, Clayton avidly promoted Clay's Compromise Tariff.  He was an ardent protectionist and aided Henry Clay in the passing of the Tariff Bill of 1833.  Clayton also acted as the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1833 and wanted to resign from the Senate in 1835 but was reelected.  However, Clayton resigned from the Senate in the fall of 1836 to become Chief Justice of Delaware and also received an honorary law degree from Yale that same year.  Clayton had remained actively involved in his home state of Delaware and in November of 1831 he served as a member of the Delaware Constitutional Convention and helped to revise the state constitution.  Clayton resigned as Chief Justice in 1839 to campaign for President Harrison.  Nevertheless, his loyalty to Henry Clay led him to refuse to become Harrison's running mate in 1840.  He moved from Dover to New Castle in 1842 where he shortly set up practice as a lawyer.  

Clayton soon reentered the national political arena with his election to a second term in the U.S. Senate in 1845.  During this time, he supported General Taylor for President in 1848 leading to a permanent rift with Henry Clay.  Taylor then appointed Clayton Secretary of State in 1849.  Clayton opened trade with the Orient and established the treaty that Commodore Perry used on his expedition to Japan.  However, his most recognized achievement as Secretary of State was his negotiation of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty with the British Government.  This treaty helped the United States avoid war with England, provided for a neutral international canal across Central America, and forced Great Britain to withdraw from territories it had occupied in Central America.  

President Taylor died before the Treaty went into effect and Clayton resigned his post.  Clayton was then reelected to a third and final term in the U.S. Senate.  He went on to defend the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty against those who were attacking it.  He died during a Congressional recess in Dover, DE.

He was educated at Pickett's School in New York City and when his father became governor, he entered the Albany Academy.  Clinton went to Hamilton College at age 14 in 1821 and graduated in 1825.  The next year he spent studying medicine with Dr. T. Romeyn Beck.  However, the death of his father in 1828 altered his plans.  Instead of medicine, he took up the study of law.  After attending the law school, he was admitted to the bar in New York CIty on May 12/13, 1831.  He opened an office in Albany a few months later and in 1832 established a partnership with Matthew Henry Webster.  By the end of that year, however, he announced a partnership in Canandaigua with John C. Spencer.  Clinton then married the daughter of his new law partner.  In 1836, the couple moved to Buffalo where he began his political and judicial careers.  In 1867, he was a delegate to the New York Constitutional Convention and was a Regent of the State Univeristy of New York from 1856 to 1885 as well as their Vice Cancellor from 1881 to 1885.  Clinton also had a great love of nature.  He wrote many papers on natural history and in 1861 was both the founder and first president of the Buffalo Society of Natural Sciences.  Clinton also published a series of legal articles from 1860 to 1868 titled the ""Digest of Decisions at Law and in Equity from the Organization of the State to 1860.""  He founded the Buffalo Historical Society and worked actively in both the Erie County Agricultural Society and the temperance movement.  He died in Albany, NY.  He left four children, two daughters and two sons who both became lawyers. ","Catalogue of the Litchfield Law School (Hartford, CT: Press of Case, Tiffany and Company, 1848), 23.

His first wife died without children.  His second wife was Louisa E. Croft.  They went on to have seventeen children.  In addition to his state political career, Cuthbert also served in the U.S. Congress.  He returned to state politics however and was appointed Secreatary of the Georgia Senate.   He was a leader in politics but ran for the U.S. Senate again and lost.  His loss was in part due to a long standing political feud in Georgia between Robert Clarke and Robert Troup that lasted twenty five years. Cuthbert was appointed by Presdient Monroe in 1822 a commissioner to treaty with the Creek and Cherokee Indians.  As a member of the Clarke faction, while the Troup faction held power in GA between 1823 and 1833, Cuthbert could not get elected as a Senator.  A new political alignment in 1833 put his brother Albert in the U.S. Senate.  In 1830, Cuthbert moved to Mobile, LA where he again practiced as a lawyer.

From 1840 - 1853 he devoted himself to his large and lucrative practice in New York City, and from 1853 - 1855 he represented one of its districts in congress, where he was a War Democrat.  Upon the nomination of Pres. Abraham Lincoln, he aided in his election campaign, and thereafter was active in supporting the cause of the Union.  After the Civil War Mr. Cutting retired from politics and quietly pursued a legal career in New York City.

Thomas Hooker.  His parents were Rev. Jeremiah Day and his third wife Abigail Osborne Day. Thomas's education began with instruction in Latin and Greek by his father and brother.  He studied at an academy in New Milford and then graduated from Yale College in 1797.  Day then attended the Litchfield Law School.  After leaving the law school, he took his brother's place as a tutor at William's College for one year and read the law with Daniel Dewey.  He then moved to Hartford in September of 1799 where he further studied under Theodore Dwight.  In 1805, Day began to attend sessions of the Connecticut Supreme Court and took notes to report on decisions.  This experience would later lead to his appointment as the first reporter of the Supreme Court of Connecticut in 1814, a position he held until 1853.  Consequently, Day published Reports of Cases, Argued and Determined in the Supreme Court of Errors, of the State of Connecticut, an extensive work consisting of two series of 26 volumes published between 1802 and 1853.  He also published a digest of this work from 1786 to 1838 and well as an 1813 digest of cases in several courts of the United States.  Day also worked as an editor of the Public Statues of Connecticut in 1808, 1821 and 1824 as well as several English law books.  Finally, Day was the author of Concise HIstory of the Judiciary of Connecticut published by the Connecticut Historical Society.  In 1821, at the May session of the General Assembly of Connecticut , members passed a revised ""Crimes and Punishments"" law. Zepheniah Swift, Lemuel Whitman, and Thomas Day, the three legal scholars who drafted the act at the legislature's request, had placed in section 14 a miscarriage clause that was without precedent in the United States. This clause was the first time that an American legislature had addressed the question of abortion in statute form, and it declared illegal the particular method of poisoning to induce abortion. Despite his busy political and legal career, Day was involved with many charitable institutions.  He served as a trustee at the Hartford Female Seminary, the Hartford Grammer School, the Retreat for the Insane, and the American Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb.  Day also worked as the Director of the Connecticut Bible Society and as the president of the Hartford County Missionary Society, the Connecticut Branch of American Education Society and the Goodrich Association.

His family moved to New York in 1806 and settled in Guilford, NY where his father became a farmer of moderate means.  As a child, Dickinson was apprenticed to a clothier and studied Latin and mathematics on his own.  For five years he taught in public and private schools, studying law and surveying at the same time.  He also read law in the office of Clark and Clapp in Norwich, NY.  During this time Dickinson married.  Unlike many law students, Dickinson attended the Law School as a married man and without having gone to college first.  He was admitted to the bar the following year and served as a lawyer and postmaster in his hometown of Guilford, NY for a short time.  He soon moved to Binghamton, NY in 1831 where he became a prominent member of the Democratic party.  He rose through the local and state ranks.  In 1844 he attended the Democratic National Covention in New York and cast his vote for James Polk.  Later that year, Dickinson was appoointed by Gov. Bouck to fill the Senate seat of N.P. Tallmadge.  He was reelected in 1845 and served for six years.  As a Senator, Dickinson spoke on the annexation of Texas, the occupation of Oregon, the Mexican War and offered opposition to the Wilmot Proviso.  He retired from Congress in 1851 and returned to his law practice.  When President Franklin Pierce nominated him to be the Collector of the Port of New York in 1853, he declined, hoping instead to receive the Democratic nomination for President in 1860.  He did not receive enough votes at the convention to be nominated.  When South Carolina seceeded from the Union, he felt the North was responsible and strove for reconciliation.  After Fort Sumter, however, Dickinson vigorously supported the Union government and made hundreds of speeches encouraging young men to enlist.  Later, Dickinson sought a Republican nomiantion to the U.S. Senate but lost.  He declined an appointment to the Northwest Boundary Commission and a seat on the Court of Appeals.

Consequently Edwards moved to Ohio in the summer of 1799 and was instrumental in the settling of that area.  He returned to New Haven in the fall of 1799 to spend the winter but returned again to Ohio in 1800.  In July of 1800, he was commissioned by Governor St. Clair (the first governor of the Northwest Territory from 1878-1802) as the Recorder of Trumbull County, OH and held that position until his death.  Until 1804, he made his residence in Mesopotamia, OH where living conditions were still very crude and difficult.  Edwards spent many of his winters in New Haven, CT, returning to Ohio every summer.  As one of the first lawyers in the area, he wrote in a letter to his family that his legal practice supported him well.  After Edwards married Louisa Maria Morris in Springfield, VT, the couple returned to Ohio in 1807 and Edwards built them their own house.  They had three sons, only one survived them.  Edwards also fought in the War of 1812 as a Colonel and when Ohio received statehood he was elected to U.S. Congress in the first congressional election in the state.  He died in Huron, OH before he could take office. ","""Moothall Society Record Books.""

Ellsworth and his wife first settled in Windsor, CT but after a few years moved to Hartford, CT where he began a successful and varied career.  Ellsworth worked as a lawyer and also pursued agricultural interests.  From 1819 to 1821 he acted as President of the Aetna Insurance Company and was also active in real estate.  In 1832, President Andrew Jackson appointed him the Commissioner to and Superintendent of Indian Settlement.  This commission involved the transplantation and resettlement of Native Americans from their homes to the south and west and Arkansas.  While in this position, Ellsworth traveled extensively in this region.  On one of those tours in eastern Oklahoma, he was accomapnied by the author Washington Irving.  In April 1835 he was elected Mayor of Hartford but resigned on June 15, 1835.  Ellsworth was then appointed by President Andrew Jackson as the first U.S. Commissioner of Patents, and consequently he presented a series of reports to Congress.  His office was also very involved with the development and distribution of seeds and made the first government investments in agriculture.  He was also influential in getting a government appropriation of $30,000 for his friend Samuel B. Morse to see the practicality of the telegraph.  On April 30, 1845, Ellsworth resigned as Commissioner of Patents.  He then moved to Lafayette, IN as the agent for the purchase and settlement of public lands, eventually becoming the largest landholder himself.  Reportedly, Ellsworth was the first to use a mowing machine on the prairies.  In 1847, his wife Nancy died from a fractured leg at the age of fifty-four.  Ellsworth remarried twice after that.  In 1858, Ellsworth returned to CT in ill health and died in Fair Haven, CT.  ","Baldwin, Roger Sherman. ""Notes on law taken from the lectures of the Honble.

However, due to poor health and headaches he found to be exacerbated by studying, he abandoned the study of the law to take up a more ""active"" profession.  Foot left Litchfield for New Haven, Connecticut and found employment there in the shipping trade centered around Long Wharf.  He became a West India Trader and went on many voyages for his health.  The War of 1812 Embargo Act destroyed his business and Foot returned to his father's home in Cheshire where he spent the rest of his life working as both a farmer and a politician.  Foot was very active in the public life of Connecticut.  He was involved in the Toleration Party which wanted a new state constitution.  He ran for Governor of Connecticut in 1824 but was defeated.  While a United States Senator, he introduced a resolution regarding the sale of public lands which led to the famous Webster-Hayne debate.  He resigned from Congress in 1834 to run again for the Governor of Connecticut, this time successfully.  He was not reelected however and finally retired from politics.  He died in Cheshire.

He graduated as the valedictorian of his class at Yale in 1809. After attending the Litchfield Law School, he worked as a tutor at Yale for the next four years until he resigned in 1814 and consequently passed the bar in New Haven. In 1815 he entered practice in New Haven. His first wife, Laura Coan, died fourteen years after they married from contracting consumption. They had five children. His second wife, Narcissa Perry Whittemore, died eleven years after they married while on a trip to Southport. In 1820, Hitchcock became associated with Seth Staples as a teacher in his private law school. He divided his time equally between his legal practice and his teaching. Hitchcock and Staples were instrumental in the founding of the Law School of Yale College. Staples moved to New York City in 1824, and left Hitchcock in charge of his law school with Judge Daggett who assisted him in his teaching. From 1824 until his death, teaching at the law school was his most important job. That same year, Yale began to publish names of law students in its annual catalogue of students. Two years later Daggett was named a Professor of Law by Yale, even though Yale did not award a Bachelor of Law degree until 1843. In 1830, Hitchcock was made an instructor in law by Yale, even though his law school still remained separate. However, in 1846, a formal act of the Yale Corporation made the law department a branch of the college. Hitchcock was renowned by his students as an effective and inspiring teacher, whose lectures were often attended by many students of disciplines other than law. He often used examples from history and literature in his classes.

Huntington then studied at the Litchfield Law School in 1808 and reamined thre until he was admitted to the bar in Litchfield County in 1810.  Unlike many students who often returned to their hometown to practice, Huntington settled in Litchfield and practiced law.  From 1828-1829 he acted as a State Representative from Litchfield.  From 1832 to 1833, he provided Judge Gould with some assistance in the running of the law school in its last year.  During this time, Hungtington also served as a U.S. Congressmen from Connecticut from 1829 to 1834.  On May 22, 1833, he married Sally Ann Huntington, the youngest daughter of his first cousin Joseph Huntington.  They did not have any children.  The following year he was appointed an Associate Judge of the Superior Court and the Supreme Court of Errors.  He then resigned his seat in Congress in June of 1834 and several months later moved to his native town of Norwich, CT.  In April of 1840, upon the death of the Hon. Thaddeus Betts, he was appointed a U.S. Senator from Connecticut and completed the remainer of Betts term from 1840 to 1845.  In order to concentrate on his political career, he resigned his Judgeship.  In 1845, Huntington was elected to a second term in the Senate.

Hunt was a descendent of Thomas Hunt who resided in Stamford, CT in 1650.  His parents were Montgomery Hunt, a Cashier at the First National Bank of Utica, and his wife Elizabeth Stringham.  He attended Oxford and Geneva Academies and in 1827 entered Hamilton College.  However, Hunt transferred to Union and graduated with honors in 1828.  He then began his legal studies at the Litchfield Law School in 1810 before returning to Utica, New York and entering the law office of Judge Hirman Denio.  Hunt was admitted to the bar in 1831, but spent that winter in the south due to his poor health.  Upon his return to New York, he began a partnership with Judge Denio and they soon had a flourishing practice.  He then married Mary Ann Savage of Salem, New York and they had two children.  His second marriage was to Maria Taylor of Albany in 1853.  In 1838, he was elected to the New York State Legislature as a Democrat and served one term.  He opposed the annexation of Texas as well as the extension of slavery into the Northern territories.  In 1822, Hunt was elected Mayor of Utica.  However, as the controversy over slavery became more fierce, Hunt eschewed his earlier politcal leanings and instead supported the candidacy of Martin Van Buren of the Free Soil Party for President in 1848.  Hunt also was instrumental in the organization of the Republican Party in New York in 1856.  In the late 1840s, he ran for the New York Supreme Court but was defeated, supposedly by the Irish vote because he had successfully defended a policeman charged with the murder of an Irishman.  At the end of the Civil War, Hunt was elected to succeed his former partner Judge Denio on the New York Court of Appeals.  Three years later in 1868, he became the Chief Justice of that same court.  In the autumn of 1872, he was nominated by President Grant to the U.S. Supreme Court on the resignation of Justice Samuel Nelson.  He took his seat on the court on January 9, 1873.   As a member of the Supreme Court, Hunt consistently sides with the Waite Court majority and upheld state regulations, bondholder claims, and police power.  He also denied claims for racial equality under the fourteenth amendment.  His earlier fight against slavery had been to prevent its extension into the Northern territories where white ""free-soil"" farmers hoped to establish themselves without competition from large plantations worked by slave labor.  His concern had not been for the welfare of the slaves of the abolition of slavery but rather for the rights of white small farmers.  Hunt also resided at the trial of Susan B. Anthony in 1873, who had voted in New York during the 1872 presidential election despite the state constitutional requirement limiting the franchise to men.  Anthony claimed that the state had denied her the privledges guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment.  However, Hunt flatly denied her argument and invoked the Slaughterhouse Cases (1873), which established the precedent that state regulations, however unjust, were under the absolute domain of the state.  Anthony received a guilty verdict, and Hunt refused to poll the jury and fined Anthony $100.  The sentence was not enforced, however, and there was no appeal.  After he suffered a stroke in 1879, Hunt received much criticism due to his refusal to retire from the bench, even though he could not perform his judicial duties.  On January 27, 1882, Congress passed a special act which allowed Federal Judges to retire with full pay at the age of seventy after ten years of service.  Hunt had only served six years but he under this act, would be allowed to retire with full benefits and this elicited great controversy.  The passage of the act was conditional on his retirement within thirty days of its passage.  He resigned on the day of its enactment.  Hunt died on March 24, 1886.

In 1819, he revised Clayton's Georgia Justice.  The following year he compiled Laws of Georgia, 1810 - 1820.   This was a significant work of 1,300 pages and many other lawyers obtained a copy for their offices.  In 1821, he became the partner of Joel Crawford when he resumed his legal practice, this time finding financial success. Lamar was reportedly prone to depression, as well as despondent, after he sentenced an apparantly innocent Methodist minister to death by hanging.  The execution was carried out and Lamar never recovered from the guilt of his misjudgement. Lamar committed suicide in Milledgeville, GA at the age of thirty-seven.

Lawrence was the Vice-President of the New-York Historical Society from 1836-45.  In 1855, he publiched an annotated edition of Henry Wheaton's Elements of International Law, which immediately becane the standard textbook on the subject.  Lawrence was a strong believer in states' rights and, although he did not defend slavery, saw it as an economic necessity and denounced abolitionists as dangerous fanatics.  He opposed secession at the outbreak of the Civil War but wrote numerous articles and books calling for the fair treatment of the South after the War.  His political views brought him great unpopularity.  However, he was well regarded internationalist and in 1868 published a four volume code of international law, Commentaire sur les Elements du Droit International.  In 1873, he argued for the defense in the case of the steamship ""Circassian"" before a Joint High Commission in which he won a reversal of a United States Supreme Court ruling.  His argument published as, Belligerent and Sovereign Rights as Regards Neutrals During the War of Secession, beame an authoritative exposition in both England and the United States of points of public law.","Catalogue of the Litchfield Law School (Hartford, CT: Press of Case, Tiffany and Company, 1849), 16.","See separate spreadsheet for image information     http://arky.ucalgary.ca/mccafferty/sites/arky.ucalgary.ca.mccafferty/files/William_Beach_Lawrence.jpg",,,"Hart, Chas.

His father was an inventor who, in 1806, ran a steamboat on the Savannah River and, in 1788, the state of Georgia had given him the exclusive rights to the steam engine.  Augustus was born in Augusta, GA, and was said to have weighed seventeen pounds at birth.  Longstreet was sent to school in Augusta but was a poor pupil and did not enjoy school.  After beginning his young education in Augusta his father moved the family to the Edgefield District in South Carolina.  After a few years however, Augustus was sent back to Augusta for more primary schooling.  His roommate at the time, George McDuffie, was reportedly an intense student who was able to get Longstreet interested in learning.  In 1808, he was sent to the Waddell School in Wilmington, SC where he boarded at the home of William Calhoun (the brother of John C. Calhoun).  While later attending Yale, as well as the Litchfield Law School, Longstreet reportedly turned his Georgia accent into an tool for social success, and passed that advice onto many Southern ""yarns"" with an exaggerated accent and provincial country manner.  He told the types of tales which he would later become famous for in his Georgia Scenes.  During all of his schooling, Longstreet was following in the footsteps of John C. Calhoun (the Calhouns being close friends of his parents).  After his marraige to Francis Parke, a very wealthy woman, the couple moved to her home in Greensboro, GA, where  Longstreet began to practice law.  Their first child was born in 1820.  Ultimately, six of their children died young and only two of their daughters survived to adulthood.  In 1824, the deaths of several of his children caused Longstreet to withdraw from politics.  Although he was nominated for the United States Congress in 1827, he changed his religious views before the election and joined the Methodist Church; consequently giving up the contest for Congress.  In 1827, he briefly took over the Augusta Sentinel.  Longstreet published his famous work Georgia Scenes in 1835 in book format (the tales had previously been a series of newspaper sketches).  This work was very popular and Longstreet saw the stories as a source of the history of old Georgia.  From 1834 to 1836, he acted as the editor/publisher of Augusta Rights' Sentinel.   However, Longstreet soon left the world of publishing as well as his leagal practice.  In 1838, Longstreet entered the Methodist ministry and gave up his law practice the following year.  He was appointed the President of Emory University in 1839.  Longstreet also received an honorary degree from Yale in 1841.  In 1844, Longstreet acted as an influential member of the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in New York, NY.  This meeting led to the rupture between the northern and southern churches over the issue of slavery.  In 1847, Longstreet published A Voice from the South, which presented a view against New England, a view that had been influenced and developed during his time in Litchfield.  While in Litchfield, Longstreet was greatly influenced by the predominantly Federalist politics of New England.  There was great opposition to the War of 1812 in New England, whereas in his home state of Georgia there was strong support for the war.  Longstreet believed that many New Englanders opposition to the war and threats of secession were treasonous, even though his later belief in the right of individual states to secede reflected what New England had believed and he had opposed when he was at the Litchfield Law School. A Voice from the South: Comprising Letters from Georgia to Massachusetts, and to the Southern States was published anonymously and offered a criticism of Northern attitudes on slavery.  While the Litchfield Law School did not deal with the moral issue of slavery in its curriculum, Tapping Reeve several times defended runaway slaves.  Longstreet was also greatly influenced by the sermons of Rev. Lyman Beecher about the importance of temperance in 1812, and he later became the leader of the early temperance movement in Georgia.  Longstreet resigned from Emory in 1849 to become President of the Centenary College in Louisiana, but left shortly after taking the position.  From 1849 to 1856, he served as the President of the University of Mississippi.  In 1857, he was elected the President of South Carolina College and was also elected an honorary member of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.  In 1861, the students at South Carolina College left in large groups to fight in the Civil War.  Longstreet thus returned to Oxford, MS where his two daughters lived.  While he had once been a strong advocate for secession, he began to urge for a compromise as the threat of war loomed.  He was a man of great regard in the South, and opposed the war even though his own invective against the North may have contributed to Southern hostility.  His home in Oxford was later burned by Union soldiers in 1862.","Catalogue of the Litchfield Law School (Hartford, CT: Press of Case, Tiffany and Company, 1849), 12.

He practiced law for several years in Boston and was a partner of the noted educator and fellow Law School graduate Horace Mann.  His son, Edward Greely Loring, would attend Harvard in 1857 and as an opthamologist would be the inventor of the opthalmoscope.  During his time on the Probate Court in Boston, Loring served as the judge in the famous Anthony Burns case.  Burns was a fugitive slave who had escaped to freedom in Massacusetts.  He was arrested on May 24, 1854 after he was found by his owner in Boston.  According to the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, Burns had to be returned to his master Colonel Charles F. Suttle of Alexandria, VA.  Boston citizens attempted to raise funds to purchase Burns' freedom and his case was brought before Loring.  Despite the intense anti-slavery feeling in Massachusetts, Loring ruled that Burns would be returned to his master in the South.  He believed that it was part of his duty as a U.S. Commissioner to uphold the Constitution and Congressional Law.  This decision would haunt him for the rest of his career in Massachusetts.  Abolitionist Wendell Phillips made the Burns case into a prominent affair and even incited a mob which marched to the courthouse where Burns was being held, killed the assistant Marshall and threatened Judge Loring's life.  In addition, the Massachusetts legislature brought Loring to trial.  Richard Henry Dana, Jr. the distinguished lawyer who attempted to help Burns, testified for Loring at his trial and argued that Loring had simply maintained his duties as a holder of a federal office.  Conversely, Wendell Phillips testified against Loring, and relied on theories of states' rights to win his case.  However, Governor Henry J. Gardner refused to execute the demand of the legislature to remove Loring from his position, a decision that cost him his reelection in 1857.  Consequently, a new governor came into office in 1858.  Loring lost his position when the probate judgeships were abolished and consolidated with the courts of insolvency.  This consolidation of the Probate Court and the Courts of Insolvency was partly to get Loring out of office, and led to a major restructuring of the Massachusetts court system.  The case of Judge Loring was th basis of the establishment of the Superior Court of Massachusetts, which was formed in 1859 to replace the Court of Common Please and the Superior Court of Suffolk County.  The Burns decision was also instrumental in preventing Loring from obtaining a full professorship at Harvard, for the Massacusetts senate was then a part of the Harvard Board of Overseers.  Loring had been a lecturer at the Dane Law School from 1852 to 1855 as well as on the committee to revise the statutes of the law school, but the overwhelming negative reaction against his decision hindered his teaching prospects at Harvard.  The difficulties Loring experienced over the Burns decision made him a hero in the South and President Buchanan decided to name him to the Court of Claims in Washington, DC.","Litchfield Eagle, October 7, 1822; Litchfield Eagle, October 6, 1823; Catalogue of the Litchfield Law School (Hartford, CT: Press of Case, Tiffany and Company, 1849), 18.","Winthrop, MA Public Library - Portrait (Oil Painting)",,,"Dimond, Alan J.The Superior Court of Masachusetts, Its Origin and Development.

He served as a member of the Provisional Congress of the Confederacy during the Civil War in 1861 and 1862 and his home was considered a center of Confederate society.

He was educated at Brown University before he attended the Litchfield Law School in 1822.  Mann was admitted to the bar in Dedham, Massachusetts in 1823 where he began practicing law.  Ten years later he began a four year term as a State Senator.  As a Senator, Horace Mann became increasingly interested in social issues.  He supported legislation to prohibit the sale of alcohol and lottery tickets, and to support the creation of state hospitals for the insane.  Mann was instrumental in leading Massachusetts to form the first state board of education.

Horace Mann’s interest in the standard of educational practices led him to give up law and his role in the Senate.  He was appointed as the Secretary of the Massachusetts State Board of Education in 1837.   Although the powers of the board were limited, it was able to affect public attitudes about school issues and to create public support for increasing the pay of teachers and improving their training through the founding of teacher-training schools.

In 1843, Horace Mann toured Europe to study educational conditions and methods.  When he returned to the United States, he championed features of European education including the abolition of corporal punishment.  He was opposed by conservator educators who believed in the practice and was attacked by church officials for advocating schools not be run by religious sects.  However, these attacks drew public attention to school issues.  Mann’s ideas were published in 12 annual reports which have become a record of the period of major educational reform in Massachusetts and the basis for a new school system throughout the entire country.

Horace Mann resigned as Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education in 1848 when he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives to fill a vacancy caused by the death of John Quincy Adams.  He served until 1853, when he became president of Antioch College (now Antioch University) in Yellow Springs, Ohio.  It was a newly founded, non-sectarian, co-educational college which symbolized the many reforms proposed by Mann in his earlier positions.

His parents were Edmunds Mason, the Clerk of the Court of Greensville, VA for twenty years, and his wife Frances Ann Young. He began his legal studies in 1816 by studying with Judge Griffin Stith of Jerusalem, VA. However, in early August of that year, Mason became very ill and took a trip to the southern part of the state. Mason later wrote that he met many lovely girls there who cured him of his afflictions. He returned to study with Judge Stith in December of 1816, but Stith died only six months later. His father wanted to send him away for further legal education, but was concerned about student ""riots"" at William & Mary in February of 1817. Therefore, he went to study at the Litchfield Law school where he was one of fourty three students from fourteen states. He married Mary Anne Fort at ""Fortsville,"" her family home which was a 2,119 acre plantation in Southampton County, VA. The couple then resided at her plantation because her mother was an invalid and Mary Anne was an only child. In 1823, Mason was assigned by Greensville County Court to represent ""Scipio,"" a slave accused of breaking into a store and taking merchandise, money, and bonds. The court paid him $25 to represent Scipio and he skillfully won an acquittal in the case. Mason then began a prominent as well as varied career in both state and federal government. He was an avid supporter of Andrew Jackson and refused to vote for the rechartering of the Bank of the United States. While in congress he introduced a bill recognizing the independence of Texas. In 1849 he retired from politics and resumed his legal practice in Richmond, VA. That same year he became the President of the James River and Kanawha Canal Project. During this time, Mason also served as the Vice President of the Virginia Historical Society. He attended the Virginia Constitutional Convention in 1850 as a presiding member.

In 1812, Sidney Morse published twelve articles signed ""Massachusetts"" in the Boston paper the Columbian Centinel, and were eventually reprinted as The New States, or a Comparison of the Northern and Southern States; with a View to Expose the Injustice of Erecting New States at the South in 1813.  Morse also published a piece in defense of his father against Helen Adams' charges of plagiarism.  Morse established the religious paper The Recorder in Boston in 1816, a paper that lasted until it merged with the Congregationalist in 1867.  In 1820, he helped his father revise Geography.  Two years later he published a new geography book with an atlas, that was titled A New System of Modern Geography.  He published a complement to this work, an Atlas of the United States in 1823.  In 1835, he began experimenting with new ways of printing maps.  On June 29, 1839 in The Observer, he published a map of Connecticut which was printed by a new process he invented described as ""cerography.""  He then worked on an apparatus called a ""bathometer"" which was to measure depth and which he patented in 1866.  Morse's brother-in-law, James K. Livingston, also attended the Litchfield Law School.","Litch. Co. Bar Assoc. Ledger = Reg.

While at the University of Georgia, he was a member of the Demosthenian Society.  Nisbet graduated from the University of Georgia with ""highest honors"" and as his class valedictorian, before he was even nineteen years old.   From 1823 to 1837, he worked as a lawyer in madison, Georgia on the Ocmulgee Circuit.  During that time, Nisbet married and he and his wife had twelve children.  Nisbet was very politically active and successively became a member of three political parties, the State-Rights, the Whigs, and the Know-Nothings. In 1830, Nisbet became a trustee of the University of Georgia.  Two years later he acted as a member of a convention which had been appointed to consider the reduction of representatives in both branches of the Legislature.  he was also offered the chair of Belles letters at both the University of Georgia and Oglethorpe College.  Nisbet was one of the founders of Oglethorpe College, and when he was elected to the chair of Belles letters there in 1835 he declined the offer.  In 1836, Nisbet lost an election for the U.S. House of Representatives.  In 1837, he moved his family to Macon, GA and established a law firm there.  He also served as the Director of the Ocmulgee Bank.  At the end of his second term in the U.S. House of Representatives, Nisbet resigned because his law firm was in debt.  As an Associate Justice of the Georgia Supreme Court, , he wrote several important opinions.  In William Culbreath vs. James M. Culbreath & Daniel C. Culbreath, he maintained that there was a distinction between ignorance of the law and a mistake in understanding it and he said that the courts had to recognize this difference.  In another case Wiley Mitchum vs. The State of Georgia, Nisbet ruled that a new trial should be granted because a lawyer had commented on unproven facts before a jury and these comments later influenced a decision by another court.  When he resigned from the bench in 1853, Nisbet resumed his law practice in Macon, GA, briefly becoming a partner of Benjamin Harvey Hill.  Nisbet was an important member of the Georgia Know-Nothing Party and was chosen delegate for the 1861 secession convention at Milledgeville, GA.  He proposed a resolution which argued for the right of Georgia to secede from the Union and to form the Southern Confederacy.  Nisbet was the Chairman of the Committee which drafted the ordinance of secession.  In 1861, he ran for Governor against Joseph H. Brown and lost, and also declined an election to the Confederate Congress.  Nisbet was the author of the first fourteen volumes of the Georgia Reports.  Nisbet also received two honorary degrees in 1868, one from his alma mater the University of Georgia and the second from Mercer University.  He continued to practice law in Macon until his death from a cold which he had contracted while laying the cornerstone of the Macon Courthouse.  He was buried in Rose Hill Cemetery.","Litchfield Eagle, October 6, 1823; Catalogue of the Litchfield Law School (Hartford, CT: Press of Case, Tiffany and Company, 1849), 19.

In 1805, Pierpont moved to South Carolina where he worked as a tutor until 1809 in the household of William Alston, the father of Joseph Alston.  He then returned to Litchfield in 1809.  He and his wife had three sons and three daughters and their first son was named for William Alston.  Pierpont then moved to Newburyport, MA where he opened a law office and also published some poetry.  He later established a dry goods business in Boston, MA with his brother-in-law Joseph L. Lord.  They also attempted to open a branch in Baltimore, MD, but it failed in the War of 1812.  While in Baltimore, MD, he published Airs of Palestine in 1816 which was regarded at the time as a great literary effort.  Rather than return to legal practice, Pierpont decided to become a minister.  After graduation from Harvard Divinity School, he became the Pastor of Hollis Street Church in Boston, MA for the next twenty-six years.  During this time, he also published two school readers, the first being The American Class Book, which was published in 1822 and the second, The National Reader, which was published in 1827.  Both readers went through many editions and were the first American readers that included selections from Shakespeare.  Pierpont also published the Airs of Palestine and Other Poems (1840) and The Anti-Slavery Poems of John Pierpont (1843).  There were some problems with his parish regarding his abolitionist and temperence views, and in 1845 Pierpont went to Troy, NY.  He worked as a minister there until 1849.  Pierpont then moved again, this time to West Medford, MA, where he again acted as a minister from 1849 to 1858.  During the Civil War, he acted as the Chaplain of the 22nd Massachusetts Regiment from September to November of 1861.  He died at West Medford, MA.  Pierpont was the grandfather of John Pierpont Morgan, and father of James Pierpont, the author of the poem ""Jingle Bells,"" which would become the well known Christmas carol.","Litch. Co. Bar Assoc.

While in Congress, Porter made a speech in favor of national support for the construction of the Erie Canal and was appointed by the New York legislatiure in 1810 to a commission which was to study plans for a canal between the Hudson River and Lake Erie.  Porter was one of the earliest and most ardent advocates for the Erie Canal.

Porter was known as a ""War Hawk"" who wanted the conquest of Canada, and was also a member of Clay's committee which considered American complaints against the British and recommended the 1812 Declaration of War.  During the War of 1812, he served as a Colonel in the New York State Militia.  His own house was even attacked by the British.  He recruited a brigade of volunteers from Pennsylvania and New York which was active on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls.  When Black Rock was captured by the British and his house became a British headquarters, Porter raised troops to expel them, During July of 1813, he was appointed by Governor Tompkins as the Brigadier General of the New York Militia and advanced to the rank of Major General.  At the conclusion of the war, President Madison offered him an appointment as Commander-in-Chief that Porter declined.  On Novembe 3,  1814 he received the Gold Medal from Congress for his military services. In 1815 and 1816 he served as Secretary of State, and in 1817 he ran for governor of New York, but was defeated by DeWitt Clinton.  In 1816, he was appointed the commissioner to determine Northwestern boundary line.  His wife Letitia was the daughter of U.S. Senator from Kentucky, John Breckenridge, and his wife Mary Cabell Breckenridge.  Letitia's brother John attended the Litchfield Law School in 1821.  From 1824 to 1830, Porter worked as the Regent of the State University of New York.  In his position of Secretary of War from 1828 until 1829, Porter's chief job was to oversee the removal of Indians from their homes to areas west of the Mississippi River.  During his flourishing political and military career, Porter's home in Washington was a popular gathering place.

He argued from an anti-slavery viewpoint in The Missouri Question, which was published in 1819.  In 1820, he published Thoughts on Political Economy.  This work established his reputation and was the first important work on this subject produced in America.  He fundamentally opposed English and French classical schools and made a distinction between individual or the sum of individual wealth versus national wealth.  Raymond defined political economy as the science of political prosperity and argued that national prosperity required a liberal measure of deliberate economic control.  This theory was in direct oppositions to Adan Smith's laissez faire policies and Raymond sought to free the national economy from foreign theories of a political economy.  After those publications, Matthew Carey (who became the cheif proponent of Raymond's theory) offered Johns Hopkins money for a chair in political economy if Raymond would take the position.  Raymond, however, declined the offer.  His next work was published in 1828 and was titled The American System.  His final work was published in 1840 and was titled Elements of Constitutional Law.

He also served as a Director of numerous railroad companies.  However, his illustrious career came to an abrupt end in 1853 when he was the subject of a major railroad stock fraud case in which stocks were issues for nonexistent routes.  His confession to the embezzlement of huge sums from the New York & New Haven Railroad Company stunned Wall Street and caused a tremendous panic in the trading of railroad stocks.  Schuyler, known as ""the great American railroad defaulter"" fled in disgrace to Europe, where he died in 1855.

Junius Smith and Aaron Burr Reeve (Tapping Reeve's son) were members of the Yale Class of 1802.  After leaving Litchfield, Smith opened a law office in New Haven in 1804.  He and his brother Aaron both gave up the law to go into the merchantile business with their father and other brothers.  The Smith brothers established a successful merchantile business in New York and Junius was sent to London England, where he remained to represent them for the next thirty-eight years.  Smith also dealt in exporting British goods from the manufacturing districts of Manchester, Leeds, and Sheffield England, to the American market.  In 1832, it took a packet some fifty-four days to cross the Atlantic.  Frustrated by this slow travel, Smith obtained British investors and launched the British and American Steam Navigation Company in 1836.  This was the first successful attempt to provide trans-Atlantic steamers.  In 1839, the company launched the ""President,"" the largest ship ever built, which disappeared without a trace.  That same year they lost the British mail subsidy to the Cunard Line.  In 1843, Smith closed the company and returned to the United States.  He established a plantation in Greenville, SC and made an unsuccessful attempt to establish American tea growing.  His anti-slavery sentiments led to a brutal beating by his neighbors in 1851, from which he never fully recovered.  He died in the Bloomingdale Asylum in New York.","Catalogue of the Litchfield Law School (Hartford, CT: Press of Case, Tiffany, and Company, 1849), 5.",,,,"Pond, E.L.

Truman Smith served as Connecticut’s Senator in the United States Congress from his inauguration on March 5, 1849 until his resignation on May 24, 1854.  During 1853, Senator Smith served on several Standing Committees, including Indian Affairs, Patents and the Patent Office, Post Office and Post Roads, Roads and Canals, and  Printing.  While serving as Senator, Smith was very active in representing his Connecticut constituents regarding international controversies, postage rates, and ports. Truman Smith's service as Senator occurred at a crucial time just before the start of the Civil War and during the discussions of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which is ardently opposed. During his term in the U.S. Senate, Smith also declined an offer to become Secretary of the Interior, and in May of 1854, Smith resigned from the U. S. Senate soon after the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act.  Following his resignation he returned to Connecticut and moved his law office from Litchfield, CT to Stamford, CT, and also opened a law office in New York City.  Smith retired from active legal practice in 1872, but remained active in several benevolent and philanthropic movements.  He later died in Stamford, CT.","Litch. Co. Bar Assoc. Ledger = Reg.

Upon completing his studies at Harvard he traveled to Litchfield, Connecticut where he studied the law at Tapping Reeve's law schol in the year 1813. He then continued his legal training with Samuel Hubbard of Boston and Levi Lincoln of Worcester before being admitted to teh bar in 1815. After his admission to the bar he went to Maine, where he was active in the separation of Maine from Massachusetts, and from 1821 until 1822 served as a state representative. In 1825 Peleg was elected to the United States House of Representatives from Maine, and held the position through 1827. In 1829 he continued his politican career when elected in the the United States Senate.  In 1835, he left the U.S. Senate to move to Boston, Massachusetts and establish a legal practice there.  In 1842 he was appointed a Judge of the U.S. Distrcit Court in Boston, although he was almost blind.  He eventually lost his sight completely and could no longer write, but could recall entire lengthy cases and explain them to a jury from memory alone.  During his time on the bench, Sprague was a staunch Conservative and was a strict believer in the U.S. Constitution.  He reportedly had a great power of analytical reasoning and made well-founded judgements.  Sprague died in Boston on October 13, 1880.","Roger S.

He sailed to Europe and passed the next two years travelling in Southern and Eastern Europe.  Stephens wrote many letters home of his exploits and in 1837 published his first travel book.  He was known affectionately by friends and family as ""the American traveler.""  In 1839, Stephens was sent on a diplomatic mission to Central America and traveled all over Guatemala, but he never found the government to which he had been accredited.  The British artist Frederick Catherwood was traveling with him and they studied ruins in Honduras, Guatemala and the Yucatan.  In 1841, he published another travel book based on his experiences titled Incidents of Travel in Central America.  The first two volumes were published in 1841 with plates by Catherwood and two more volumes were published in 1843.  As an avid traveler with a great interest in quicker transportation, Stephens became a major promoter of steam navigation.  He became a sponsor of the Ocean Steam Navigation Company and started a line to Bremen, Germany in 1847.  This was the first line to take advantage of U.S. government subsidies for carrying mails.  Stevens was also an active supporter of the Hudson River Railroad.  His last great project started in 1849, when he helped to establish the Panama Railroad.  He first served as the Vice President and later as the President, spending two years in Panama to oversee the project before returning to New York City, NY in the spring of 1852.  Stephens died only shortly afterwards.  A monument was erected to him at the highest point of the Panama Railroad when it was opened in 1855.","Litchfield Eagle, October 6, 1823; Catalogue of the Litchfield Law School (Hartford, CT: Press of Case, Tiffany and Company, 1849), 19.

After his graduation from the Andover Theological Seminary, he returned to Georgia as a result of his failing eyesight and became an ordained evangelist of the Hopewell presbytery.  After his second marraige in 1828, Stiles and his second wife had four daughters and one son.  Stiles then began a series of moves all over the country, preaching in each location.  He first moved to Darien, GA in 1829 and the following year returned to Savannah, GA where he became the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church.  In 1835, he moved with his family to central, Kentucky.  However, in 1844, he moved to Richmond, VA where he preached at the Grace Street Presbyterian Church.  Two years later he received an honorary degree from Transylvania College.  In 1848, he moved to New York City and worked at the Mercer Street Church.  In 1850, he became the General Agent of the American Bible Society in the South.  He then relocated his family to new Haven, CT where Gerard Hallock had built a Church especially for him.  His work as a General Agent for the Southern Aid Society in 1853 caused him to work for the aid of the poor southern churches and he remained sympathetic to their plight,  In 1857, however, the American Home Missionary Society withdrew aid to southern churches over the issue of slavery.  Nevertheless, Stiles later left his wife and four daughters in New Haven, CT and returned to the South at the beginning of the Civil War.  He worked as and Evangelist Chaplain to the Confederated Troops with Stonewall jackson from 1861 to 1862.  After the war ended, he travelled as an evangelist throughout the South.  He gave sermons until 1874 and later died in Savannah, GA.","Handwritten list by William Samuel Johnson, ""Catalogue of the Students at Law in the school at Litchfield Conn. at & after Aug. 15th 1817.."", Connecticut Historical Society, Johnson Family Papers, 1722-1863, Box - Johnson Papers;  Josiah Houghton, LLS Law Notebook 1817-1818, ""Catalogue of the Officers and Students of the Law Institution, Litchifeld, Cont.""; Catalogue of the Litchfield Law School (Hartford, CT: Press of Case, Tiffany and Company, 1849), 14.

He had become a leader of the Federalist Party in the state of New York, and consequently was strongly against the implementation of new taxes to fund the War of 1812.  As an associate of the Federalists within the state, he took a very conservative stance at the Constitutional Convention of 1821 and opposed the extension of the franchise to non property-holders.  He was against the Presidency of Martin Van Buren and displayed a strong devotion to property rights.  In addition, he served as the President of the Bank of Columbia at Hudson, NY.  Williams owned a large tract of land and in 1815, he founded the town of Waterloo in Seneca County, NY.  He amassed a huge fortune through his law practice connections, principally in the form of Seneca County, NY real estate.  After he became wealthy, Williams moved to Seneca County, NY in 1830.  However, he later returned to Hudson, NY.  Williams died on a visit to New York City from apoplexy at the home of Mr. Grovesnor.

In the summer of 1779, Wolcott volunteered to aid his father, who was in charge of army stores and ordinance in Litchfield.  After completing his service, however, Wolcott began a prominent political rather than military career.  Wolcott was well educated, and put his training to use through a noted political career.  He graduated from Yale in 1778 and entered  the Litchfield Law School, studying under Tapping Reeve. In 1781, he was admitted to the Bar and received a Master's degree from Yale.  His political appointments included the Committee of the General Assembly in 1782, followed by the Commissioner for the state of Connecticut; rising rapidly to the to the position of the Connecticut Comptroller in 1788 and (a year later) Auditor in the national Treasury Department. In 1791, he became the Comptroller of the United States Treasury.  In 1795, Oliver was appointed the second Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of America by Pres. George Washington. He held the position into the administration of Pres. John Adams, retiring in 1800.  In April of 1803, Oliver was elected president of Merchant's Bank and held the position for a year. He went on to help found the Bank of America and was elected its first president in 1812. He held that position for two years. After that retirement, he returned to Litchfield.  In 1817, Oliver ran for the seat of Governor of Connecticut under the Democratic/Toleration ticket and won. He was re-elected to the position for ten consecutive years, finally ending his administration in 1827.  In addition to a full public life, Wolcott served in the military during the Revolutionary War and enjoyed a successful business life.  His ventures included the Litchfield China Trading Company, Oliver Wolcott & Co., and the Litchfield Manufacturing Company (commonly known as the Wolcott Manufacturing Company).  They included foreign trade, manufacturing merino wool, and retail sales.  In 1785, he married the daughter of Captain John Stoughton, who attended Yale in 1755.  The couple had been married only ten years when she died of consumption on September 24, 1805 at the age of thirty-eight.  They had five sons, three of whom had died in infancy, and two daughters.

Woodbridge became highly influential within the fledgling Michigan government.  As Michigan's first delegate to Congress, he worked on a boundary dispute between Michigan and Ohio.  Woodbridge also declined a second term as delegate for Michigan.  During his term in the Michigan senate, the panic of 1837 led to a public demand for a change from Democratic control of the government.  As a result, he launched a successful campaign as the Whig candidate for Governor of Michigan in 1839.  After his term in the U.S. Senate, Woodbridge later retired to his Detroit area farm where he later died.","Catalogue of the Litchfield Law School (Hartford, CT: Press of Case, Tiffany, and Company, 1849), 4.","See separate spreadsheet for image information","Detroit Public Library: Willliam Woodbridge Papers, 1763-1919                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library: Woodridge Family Papers, 1841-1883                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Boston Public Library - William Woodbridge Papers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Central Michigan University, Clarke Historical Library - William Woodbridge Papers, 1810-1860                                                                                                                                                                                                             Monroe County Historical Musuem Archives - Correspondence in Charles Noble Papers, 1821-1869                                                                                                                                                                                                        New-York Historical Society - William Woodbridge Papers, 1820-1840                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Pierpont Morgan Library (NY,NY) - William Woodbridge Papers, 1820                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   State Historical Society of Wisconsin, Archives Division - Correspondence in Peter Barbeau Papers, 1789-1909                                                                                                                                                                                  State Historical Society of Wisconsin, Milwaukee Area Research Center University of Wisconsin - Correspondence in Robert Eliot and Norman Emmons Papers, 1840-1882                                                         Western Reserve Historical Society - Correspondence in Edward Tiffin Papers, 1785-1853",,,,

He was the son of Peter and Mary Woodbury.  He began his legal practice in Francestown, NH in 1812.  He was one of the few New England Republicans in a mostly Federalist area.  He gained great popularity for an address he made against President James Madison during the War of 1812.  Woodbury consequently gained much fame and political reputation at the young age of twenty-three.  In 1816, the Republicans gained cotrol of the state and took (state) control of Dartmouth College.  He was appointed as a Trustee, but in 1819, John Marshall delivered a U.S. Supreme Court verdict against the Republicans.  [UNCLEAR?]  Woodbury wrote The Hillsborough Resolves [???].  In 1817, Woodbury was known as the ""baby"" judge for he was the youngest ever appointed Judge of New Hampshire at the age of only twenty-seven.  While serving on the bench, he helped prepare three volumes of Woodbury and Minot's New Hampshire Reports.  One of his important cases while on the New Hampshire bench was Merrill v. Sherburne, which regarded legislative encroachment upon judicial power.  Woodbury ruled that ""...it is inseparable from the structure of the legislative and judicial departments, that jealousies should arise between them as the exerciseof their respective powers [but] ...though thus, situated, both ought to rejoice that the their own errors can be discovered and corrected.""  [NEED CITATION] His ruling stated that the legislature could not interfere with or undertake judicial functions, unless there was a ""specific constitutional sanction"" for such action.  This decision determined that the legislature could only interfere with judicial process and decisions in extreme cases.  In 1819, Woodbury moved to Portsmouth, ME and married the daughter of Asa and Elizabeth (Wendell) Clapp of Portland ME.  Asa Clapp was the wealthiest merchant in Portland, ME and a leading Republican.  Elizabeth Clapp brought a dowry of $50,000 to the marraige as well as a house in Portsmouth, ME, which gave Woodbury a socially and economically secure base.  This also allowed Woodbury to add a seacoast merchant base to his inland roots of support.  They had four daughters and one son.  In 1823, he was elected Governor of New Hampshire by the ""Young America"" faction of the Democrat and Federalist parties.  He was defeated for a secod term as Governor, but while serving as governor, he made a speech recommending more education for women.  In addition, when the New Hampshire Historical Society was formed in 1823, he was named its first Vice-President.   While serving in the U.S. Senate, he became known as the ""Rock of New England Democracy.""  Woodbury was an avowed isolationist and became a supporter of a ""mildly protective tariff.""  During his time in the Senate, he opposed President Adams and became a Jacksonian.  Woodbury also advocated the annexation of Texas and the ocupation of Oregon.  In 1826, he gave a major speech in opposition to the pending judiciary bill which sought to expand the U.S. Supreme Court from seven to ten members.  Woodbury feared Congress would pack the court.  In addition, while he did not agree with slavery as an institution he felt that the right to abolish or preserve slavery lay in the hands of individual states.  When he retired from the Senate, Woodbury returned to Portsmouth, NH where he wrote of recent social and political changes.  As Secretary of the Navy, he reorgainized the Survey of the Coast under a scientific corps (1832).  He became Secretary of the Treasury after the Senate refused to confirm Jackson's first choice of Roger B. Taney.  Woodbury favored an independent treasury for the United States rather than private banks.  During his second term in the U.S. Senate, Woodbury spoke of the need for a Presidential veto, attacked the Whig measures of Clay and displayed an increasing belief in states' rights that would influence many of his decisions as a Supreme Court Justice.  His increasing emphasis on this area made him a more appealing candidate to Southerners during this period of sectional hostility, although he was certainly not pro-Southern or pro-slavery. In 1845, he was offered an ambassadorship to London which he declined.  He served as a Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court for five years during the unstable period of the Taney court of the late 1840's.  In several important cases, he upheld the constitutionality of state prohibition legislation.  He ruled with the majority in the License Cases of 1847 and upheld state prohibition statutes.   However, in the Passenger Cases in 1849 he dissented from the majority and believed that states could constiturtionally regulate immigrants without violating the Constitution's Commerce Clause.  Woodbury consistently defended state's rights to make laws for themselves if they did not defy the Constitution and to find a ""middle ground between private rights and public interest.""  This belief was reflected in several highly controversial cases surrounding the issue of slavery.  In the case of Jones vs. VanZandt, he ruled that slavery was a political question that had to be deterined by each individual state.  VanZandt was an Ohio citizen sued by a Kentuckian for harboring a fugitive slave.  William H. Seward and Salmon P. Chase represented the Abolitionists and argued that the Fugitive Slave Act of 1792 was unconstitutional, because higher moral laws took precedence over slave catching statutes.  However, Woodbury was a strict constructionalist and ruled against them.  He held that this issue had been settled in Prigg v. Pennsylvania, and that higher moral laws did not supercede constitutional laws.  This decision won him much political respect in the South.  Although he thought slavery was wrong, he believed that in order to preserve the Constitution and the Union, laws supporting slavery had to be upheld until they were repealed.  Woodbury was one of the few politicians on the bench and brought experience from both the legislative and executive branch of government.  In 1849, when the Massachusetts legislature turned down a charter for the Catholic College of the Holy Cross, Woodbury felt that Catholics had the right to teach their beliefs in their own school.  The motion passed in the next legislature.  [HOW WAS HE INVOLVED IN THIS??]  Woodbury became somewhat unpopular in his home area of New England, when he spoke out in favor of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law.  In addition, during the highly publisized and controversial 1851 case in Boston, MA of Thomas Sims (a fugitive slave from Georgia) he upheld the law and ruled that Sims should be returned to Georgia.  His final case involved a slave case in Rhode Island, where he ruled again that higher moral laws against slavery could not override the Constitution.  He believed that as long as slavery existed in the Southern states and that there were laws preventing aid to fugitive slaves, it was his legal duty to uphold those laws in order to preserve both the Constitution and the Union.  Woodbury died only two months after the conclusion of this case.  At the time of his death, he was being considered as a candidate for the Presidency, but after his death Franklin Pierce was nominated.  He received two honorary degrees during his life, one from Dartmouth and one from Princeton.  Three volumes of his writings were published after his death.","Catalogue of Litchfield Law School (Hartford, Connecticut: Press of Tiffany, Case and Company, 1849), 7.

Wright was the founder of several businesses within Cincinnati, including the Cincinnati Merchantile Library, the Cincinnati Hamilton and Daytin Railroad, the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company, and the Spring Grove Cemetery Association.  During the two election campaigns of William Henry Harrison in 1836 and 1840, he traveled as the companion of Harrison and took charge of his political correspondence.  Wright later became the partner of Charles Hammond in the Cincinnati Gazette, and also worked as the editor with his son until 1854.  In his office, Wright installed the first steam printing press west of the Allegheny Mountains.  In addition, the first telegraph dispatch sent by Samuel F.B. Morse from New York was received at his home.  Wright also acted as a delegate to the Peace Conference in Washington, D.C. in February of 1861.  He was elected the Presiding officer, but died of a pneumonia only a few days later.  His body ""lay in state"" in the Capitol, and was sent by a special train accompanied by a delegation of Congressmen and Senators to Cincinnati, OH.  He was buried at Spring Grove Cemetery and at the Centennial celebration at Steubenville, OH.  A large oil painting portrait of him was unveiled in the Supreme Court Room.",,,"Library of Congress, Manuscript Division - Papers of John C.
