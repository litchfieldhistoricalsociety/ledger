After returning to her hometown however, her fiance Alexander Fisher died and Catherine entered a deep depression.  Later that year, she opened the Hartford Female Seminary  and she hired John Pierce Brace to replace her as principal of the school in 1832.  Brace and Beecher were close friends from their time together in Litchfield.  Beecher was deeply influenced by Pierce and Brace's teaching methods, using many of them in her own school, however as Brace noted privately and publically, she never credited the Litchfield Female Academy or Brace for the role they played in molding her theories on education.  After Brace took over her role at the seminary in Hartford Catharine moved to Ohio and served as the head of the Cincinnati Ladies' Seminary in 1832. In addition to her education work, Catharine also did benevolent work and was an author. Her father Lyman Beecher graduated from Yale College in 1797 and received an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from Middlebury College in 1818.

"Lydia Booth",,"Booth",,"Female","1814, 1815",,,"Poughkeepsie/ NY/ United States",,,,,,,,"Educator",,"/ VA/ United States",,,"May 17, 1803","November 6, 1854","George Booth",,1869,,"Manufacturer","Mary Armstrong Booth",,1804,"Born in Poughkeepsie on March 17, 1803, Lydia  Booth was the daughter of George Booth, a wool manufacturer, and Mary Armstrong Booth. After her mother's death her father re-married  Maria Vassar (the sister of Matthew Vassar). From 1814 to 1815, she attended Sarah Pierce’s Litchfield Female Academy in Connecticut, where she received rigorous academic and religious training. It was probably at Miss Pierce’s school that Booth acquired the intellectual interests that prompted her to suggest that her uncle establish an institution of higher education for women. Miss Pierce firmly adhered to the notion of “Republican Motherhood” which held that women are responsible for their children’s moral and intellectual instruction and thus should receive advanced education. Booth’s obituary in the Poughkeepsie Eagle noted that Miss Pierce’s instructions “left their ineffaceable influence in her [Booth’s] heart and life - her manners and purpose – through all her subsequent years.” After Litchfield, Booth returned to Poughkeepsie where she taught at a “Family School,” instructing her siblings and neighbors’ children. She then attended a finishing school in New York City.

In 1824 Booth moved to Virginia and taught in Tappahanock and Fredericksburg, returning to Poughkeepsie in 1837 to open what would later be called the Poughkeepsie Female Seminary. The seminary offered classes in algebra and geometry, subjects not usually offered at women’s schools of that time. When the seminary outgrew its first site, Matthew Vassar purchased a building on Garden Street where Booth established Cottage Hill Seminary, in which he took a spirited interest, visiting it often.

In 1845 Vassar traveled in Europe, examining a number of hospitals with the intention of establishing one himself when he returned to Poughkeepsie. In her correspondence with him, however, his niece urged him to establish a college for women instead. How, she asked, could women train their children if they did not have an education themselves? Vassar later attributed “the early direction of my mind for the enlarged education of women"" to his relationship with his niece. Lydia Booth died on November 6, 1854, before her uncle, still intent on endowing a hospital, had taken any definite steps towards the establishment of a women’s college.

However, in the Spring of 1855, having come to Poughkeepsie from Alabama where he had established a similar institution, Professor Milo P. Jewett purchased and reopened Cottage Hill Seminary. Jewett joined the Central Baptist Church where Vassar worshipped, and Jewett soon suggested, apparently independently of Booth, that Vassar endow a college for women.

Because of Booth’s early encouragement of her uncle to establish a women’s college, Vassar's legendary Professor of History Lucy M. Salmon called her “the real founder of Vassar College.” Vassar himself did not acknowledge Booth until well after the college’s founding when, in an address to the trustees on February 23, 1864, he set the record straight:

It is due to truth to say that my great interest on the subject of female education was awakened not less than twenty years ago by an intimate female friend and relative, now deceased, who conducted a seminary of long standing and character in this city . . . It was this fact, more than any other, and more than all others, that awakened me early to the possibility and necessity of an institution like the one we now propose.

He wrote a letter to Eliza in the form of a poem in which he names each of the conspirators and chastizes them for their part in the prank.  In his journal he remembers the incident, ""the girls at Miss Pierce's, knowing my fondness for female society and my easy susceptibility, form'd a plan to make me believe that Fanny Goodwin, a little girl of twelve, was in love with me.  The deception was carried on for some days and was complete.  To an awkward, homely boy, with but slight confidence in his own powers of pleasing, the idea of love returned was exquisite.  It was the first sip of that delightful cup of which I have drank so deep in life, and its very teaste, deceitful as it as, intoxicated me.

 “Much ado about nothing.”  An ecclaircisement has taken place relative to the “mysterious” lady who has excited so much interest on Oneida county.  She is discovered to be a Miss Lathrop of Sherburne, who was educated at Litchfield in Connecticut; had returned a short time since to her friends, and had started, as was supposed, for Johnstown, where she represented she had taken a school.  Among various visitors who were prompted by curiosity to see the mysterious stranger, was a young gentleman from Sherburne, who she immediately recognized and veiled her face.  It excited suspicion, and on a closer examination he discovered who she was.  She plead a derangement of her senses as an excuse for her conduct.  It is supposed however that she got lost or bewildered going to the place where she was to take the stage, and patched up her story in order to avoid exposure and excite the sympathy of the people.  She is now at Sherburne.

In 1800, the leading men of Middlebury, VT, who were acquainted with the Litchfield Female Academy, asked Sarah Pierce to advise them in the creation of a similar school.  Pierce traveled to Middlebury with Idea and stayed in Middlebury long enough to see the school established.  Idea based the curiculum of the Middlebury Female Academy entirely on the Litchfield Female Academy.  Just two years after it's creation, the Middlebury Female Academy held a subscription to erect an academy building.  The school enrolled pupils from across Vermont and upstate New York.  Idea Strong died soon afterwards however in 1804.   The school was taken over in 1804 by Emma Hart, who later married Dr. John Willard in 1809 and eventually moved to Troy, NY to establish the famous Troy Female Seminary in 1821.  ","Dr. Josiah Beckwith recounts the formation of the Middlebury Female Academy in an interview he did with ENV for Chronicles, ""Miss Pierce and Idea, daughter of Hon. Jedediah Strong, whose house stood with the McNeils now live and whose name, then as now, was graven on a white mile stone, accompanied him [Moses Seymour, Jr.] as far as Middlebury; where a school was established for Miss Strong, and countenanced and encouraged by the presence of Miss Pierce.  This school had an existence for several years;  Miss Strong fell victim to the rigors of the Vermont climate, and was succeeded by Miss Emma Willard who eventually moved it to Troy, N.Y.""

Their horse had tired out, so that Nancy Starkweather, Mary Griswold and Mary Bulkley who would not stay, came up, partly on foot, and partly in the cutter leaving the other girls at a tavern under the protection of Alexander McLachlan (a little boy).  Father would not let me go.  Today I hear a vast many different stories that I do not know which I believe.  Some say they wanted to stay & some say they did not.  After meeting they came up."" (JPB Journal January 12, 1812)  Later upon hearing of her marriage to George, John Pierce Brace made this comment in his journal, ""volatile * Coquettish, her love of pleasure I should suppose could never permit her to sit quietly down as the mistress of a family and give up the pleasure of vanity & conquest which have so long actuated her . . . I cannot conceive how she will behave as a wife when as a girl her feelings & practice were so flightly & thoughless.""  (JPB Journal 1814)  John Pierce Brace contradicts this statement however later in life when writing his History of My Poetry Vol. II.  There he says of Cornelia, ""Cornelia Van Kleek was from Poughkeepsie, a sister of Sally Ann she had a very bright beautiful face.  Her eyes were black & sparkling, and the whole expression of the face that of good natured fun.  She loved mischief howeve and was an imprudent girl.  Shew as a great flirt.  I was a very good friend of hers, and in her confidence.  I corresponded with her for some time.  She came to Litchfield Nov. 1810 and stayed two years.  She married a New York man by the name of Somervandyke who proved an inefficient man.  Cornelia became an energetic woman & supported her family by taking borders.  She lives now in Brooklyn, N.Y. with a married daughter.  Her husband, I believe is dead.  I have not seen her for many years.""  (More Chronicles page 143)  Cornelia and George had five children.

She returned to the Beecher house around 1816 to teach music at the LFA.  She shared a room with Catherine Beecher and they became close personal friends.  Louisa taught music at LFA from 1816 to 1821.  She also taught in Philadelphia.  At some point prior to 1818, Louisa became secretly engaged to Uriel Holmes, Jr. the son of Judge Holmes of Litchfield.  After graduating from Yale in 1816 and beginning the study of theology at the Andover Seminary, Holmes returned to Litchfield and died of consumption in 1818.  By 1819, Louisa was then known to be romantically involved with William Tracy Gould, the son of James Gould a teacher at the Law School.  William had just graduated from Yale was a current student at the Law School.  He was several years younger than Louisa.  Fanny Lyman, a student at the Female Academy wrote to William Greene in June of 1820, ""William Gould is supposed to be engaged to Louisa Wait . . . he has treated her with marked attention for a year past and has been told of the disadvantage resulting from such attention but he still persists in his visits to and it is now believed by everyone to be a match.""  In 1821, William left Litchfield and went to Clinton, GA to establish a legal practice.  The engagement continued until 1824 when Louisa was at that time living in Philadelphia and William was in Augusta, GA.  However soon afterwards, William was married to a woman from Georgia.  Louisa became consumptive soon afterwards and died at her sister's home in Burlington, VT in 1826.  John Pierce Brace said of Louisa, ""Louisa Wait was al ittle younger than myself & had been at Litchfield school for some time.  She was the daughter of Capt. Thomas Wait of New London, who died not far from this time and left his family poor.  Louisa was a slight figure, pretty features, pleasent blue eyes an dwith an uncommon fresh blooming complexion.  She was called very pretty.  She left school soon after.  On August 10, 1816 she makes her apperance once more in my private journal, she then came on to be Music mistress at our School.  She continued in that station until some time in 1821.  She became engaged to Wm. T. Gould, who was much younger than she.  After leaving Litchfield, she taught school in Philadelphia.  Upon Gould's desertion of her, she fell into a consumption and died.  She passed through Litchfield when sick, in 1824 and died at her sister's in Burlington in 1826.  She was talented, amiable & a beautiful girl, a very great friend of mine and of Lucy's.""
