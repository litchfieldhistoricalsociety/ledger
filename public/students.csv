As a lawyer, he was quick in apprehension, sound in practical judgment, forcible in argument, eminently fair towards opponents, and popular, successful, and effective in his management of cases both before juries and courts.

Bacon attended several schools and academies in Canterbury and Windham before entering Yale College in 1789. Bacon graduated from Yale with a distinguished record in 1793 and immediately afterward worked in the law office of General Cleveland in his native town of Canterbury. After spending six months there, he entered the Litchfield Law School and prepared to enter the practice of law. He was admitted to the Connecticut bar in 1795.     Bacon then went to Virginia and was admitted to the bar after great difficulty and expense, settling for three years in Leesburg, Virginia. In 1798, Bacon returned to Canterbury and opened a law office. Bacon took on four students, three of whom were from Massachusetts, and all of whom went on to great distinction. One became governor of that state, another was a judge on the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, and another became a Congressman from New York State. After practicing law for seven years in Canterbury, Bacon was elected to the Connecticut House of Representatives in 1800.     In 1803 he relocated to Litchfield, Connecticut at the invitation of the former congressman John Allen to become his partner. Due to his failing health, however, Allen retired in 1812.

He ran for the United States Congress and lost for ten consecutive years between 1806 and and 1816. While Bacon did not succeed in establishing a successful political career, he maintained a full legal practice until he was sixty years old.     In 1832, 'pneumoniac attacks' forced him to retire from the bar as he was unable to continue public speaking. Despite this challenge, Bacon pursued a new career as the president of the Phoenix Branch Bank of Litchfield from 1833 to 1846. When his policies proved to be too cautious for many shareholders he resigned from the position, sold his Litchfield property and moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 1851 where he lived until his death.

Like his father, William Johnson Bacon was actively involved both with legal and political practices. Bacon was a Judge on the Supreme Court of New York from 1853 to 1870 as well as a member of the New York Legislature in both 1850 and 1861. He was a third generation United States Congressman serving from 1877 to 1879 and became a trustee of Hamilton College from 1856 until his death in 1889 in Utica, New York.","Catalogue of the Litchfield Law School (Hartford, CT: Press of Case, Tiffany and Company, 1849), 19.

In 1803, his father moved the family to the Mississippi Territory, and in 1811 they moved again, this time to Oaklawn Plantation in St. Mary Parish. He entered West Point from Louisiana on September 18, 1817, and graduated in 1819. In July of that year he received an appointment as a second lieutenant in the Artillery Corps. In addition, Baker served as an assistant professor of engineering at West Point and was on the West Point Board of Examiners until his resignation on October 31, 1820. After leaving West Point, Baker attended the Litchfield Law School in 1821, and upon his return to Kentucky he was admitted to the bar in 1822. He opened his first law practice in Opelousas, Louisiana, and in 1829 he moved to St. Mary's Parish where he served as judge from 1829 through 1839. From the mid-1820's through the mid-1840's Baker held a variety of political and military positions. He also owned three sugar plantations: Black Baou in Terrebonne Parish, Grand River in St. Martin, and Fairfax in St. Mary. His next major political assignment was not until 1867, when he served for a year as the Military Governor of Louisiana by the appointment of General Hancock. Although it is known that Baker married, the identity of his wife is unknown. As a result of financial setbacks Baker retired to Lyme, Connecticut, the home of his daughter Margaret Van Bergen, where he died in 1886.

Alexander J. Dallas in Philadelphia, PA. ",Chariman of the Committee on Domestic Manufacturers from 1819-1822.,,"Henry Baldwin was the son of Michael Baldwin and Theodora Wolcott Baldwin. After his parents' death in 1787 he resided with his half-brother, politician and first president of the University of Georgia, Abraham Baldwin. Henry attended the Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven in 1793 and then graduated from Yale College in 1797 at the age of eighteen. He attended the Litchfield Law School following his studies at Yale and then went to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where he studied law for several months with the Honorable Alexander J. Dallas. He was admitted to the Philadelphia bar on March 6, 1798.     In 1799, Baldwin started for Ohio to join his brother Michael and stopped in Pittsburgh, which in that year was a city with a population of 1500. Baldwin married Mariana Norton in May of 1802. She was his third cousin and the daughter of Nathaniel Norton of Bloomfield, New York. She died only one month after their only son was born. After his first wife's death, Baldwin married Sally Ellicott of Lancaster, Pennsylvania on June 11, 1805. She was the daughter of Major Andrew and Sally Brown Ellicott, and survived Baldwin with an adopted daughter.     Baldwin was admitted to the Allegheny County Bar on April 30, 1801 and was reported to have a practice that extended into all the counties west of the Allegheny River and into some parts of Ohio. His law partners were Tarleton Bates of Virginia and Walter Forwards, and they were known as the 'Great Triumvirate of Early Pittsburgh'. Together they bought the Republican newspaper <I>The Tree of Liberty</I>.     Baldwin also had mill interests in Pennsylvania and Ohio, especially the iron rolling and woolen mills. Furthermore, Baldwin had a flourishing political career. In 1816/1817, he was elected as a Democrat to Congress from Pennsylvania and drafted the tariff of 1820. He wanted a protective tariff for goods produced within the United States, and earned a reputation within Congress as an 'economic nationalist'. In addition, Baldwin was one of the only eighteen men from non-slave states who voted for the Missouri Compromise. He opposed the passage of an anti-slavery proviso in the Missouri Compromise, for he hoped that by doing so he would gain the support of the Southerners for his 1820 bill to raise tariffs. However, the Southerners in Congress did not rally behind his bill, and it lost in the Senate by one vote.    In 1822, Baldwin resigned from Congress due to poor health and was ill for the next two years. Nevertheless, Baldwin returned that same year to his legal practice. Baldwin had an extensive law library and was involved in many important cases. In 1828, he supported Andrew Jackson for president, and was disappointed when he did not receive the promised post of Secretary of the Treasury. However, in 1829, Baldwin was instead offered a place on the Supreme Court upon the death of Justice Bushrod Washington.     On January 4, 1830, President Jackson nominated Baldwin to the United States Supreme Court, and two days later his nomination was confirmed by the Senate. Baldwin held his position as a Justice of the Supreme Court until his death in 1844. Notably, Baldwin often challenged the views of the Constitution held by Chief Justice Marshall and Justice Story. In the term of 1831, he dissented seven times, whenever he believed the court to be encroaching on state powers. Baldwin was also involved in several important cases during his time on the Supreme Court. One case was U.S. v. Arrendono in 1832 which established the principle that land claims resting on acts of foreign governments had to be presumed valid unless the U.S. could prove otherwise. In addition, in the case of Holmes v. Jennison in 1840, he upheld the right of a state to surrender fugitives to a foreign country even though this interfered with the power of the federal government in foreign affairs. He also stood against President Jackson during his attack on the Bank of the U.S. Baldwin had upheld the legality of the actions of the bank, while the Secretary of the Treasury Roger Taney and President Jackson had opposed the rechartering of the bank. In 1833, he was confined to a hospital and missed the first court term of that year. Baldwin wrote over forty majority opinions while on the Supreme Court, but as time passed fewer of these opinions were clear expositions of constitutional doctrine. He increasingly withdrew into paranoid isolation and dissented with little comprehensible reason.    Baldwin received his second honorary law degree from Jefferson College in Pennsylvania in 1843, but for the last four years of his life, Baldwin was reported to have a violent temper, and while there were doubts about his sanity there was no attempt made to remove him from the bench. By 1844 he was deeply in debt, and he died on April 21, 1844 in Philadelphia from a stroke he had suffered a week earlier.

CT Presidential Elector in 1860.,"Roger Sherman Baldwin was the descendant of John Baldwin, one of the original settlers of New Haven, Connecticut. His father, Simeon Baldwin, was a prominent politician and judge in both New York and Connecticut. His mother Rebecca Sherman died when he was only two years old on September 4, 1795, and his father married his mother's younger sister Elizabeth Sherman Burr, the widow of Sturges Burr of New York City.     Baldwin studied at the Hopkins Grammar School under his cousin Henry Sherman, and entered Yale College in 1807. He graduated from Yale in 1811 with honors when he was eighteen years old. Baldwin entered the Litchfield Law School in 1812, following in the footsteps of his brother Ebenezer Baldwin, who had attended the Law School in 1810. He was admitted to the bar in New Haven in 1814. Since his father was then serving as a judge on the bench, he began his law practice alone.     On October 25, 1820, Baldwin married Emily Perkins, the youngest daughter of Enoch Perkins of Hartford, a Yale classmate of his father's. They had nine children, and four of their surviving sons would attend Yale.     Like many law school graduates, Baldwin pursued a considerable political as well as legal career. In 1826, Baldwin was elected to the City Common Council of New Haven. From 1837 to 1838, he served as a member of the Whig Party in the State Senate, holding the office of president pro term in 1838. Baldwin then served in the Connecticut State House of Representatives from 1841 to 1842.     Baldwin's abolitionist sentiments were an integral part of his legal career. He once defended and secured the freedom of a runaway slave, and later stood up to an angry crowd who opposed the building of a training school for African Americans in New Haven. Perhaps the most notable legal case in the career of Roger Sherman Baldwin was that of the slave ship <i>Amistad</i>. Baldwin revealed his anti-slavery sentiments in the Amistad case when he defended the slaves who had revolted on the schooner and were charged with murder and piracy. He defended the case along with former president John Quincy Adams in front of the Supreme Court from 1839 to 1840.     In 1843, Baldwin ran as a Whig for governor and was defeated, but he launched a successful campaign in 1844, and was re-elected in 1845. During his gubernatorial term, Baldwin undertook extensive statewide reforms that allowed Connecticut to thrive. For example, Baldwin took on education reform in Connecticut. He organized a Committee on Education under a State Superintendent of Schools whose duty it was to organize and standardize education statewide. He also lessened statewide restrictions on immigration, allowing huge numbers of Irish and German immigrants to boost Connecticut manufacturing. Furthermore, Baldwin addressed common fraudulent election practices by reinstating a law that required voters to be registered with a local official. He also recommended undertaking numerous other reforms, including prison labor, temperance, bankruptcy, and elections to the General Assembly although he had little success with these.    During this same period, Baldwin received two honorary LLD's from Trinity College and Yale College. In addition, from 1847 to 1851, Baldwin served as the United States Senator from Connecticut where he made many important speeches. He spoke out against the Mexican War and its implications, particularly citing how the war had made possible the extension of slavery by the admission of California as a state. In 1850, Baldwin also made a speech condemning the Fugitive Slave Law.     After leaving Congress in 1851, Baldwin resumed his legal practice which was reported to be more lucrative than that of any other lawyer in the state. Baldwin again entered the political arena, when in 1860 he served as a Presidential Elector and voted for Abraham Lincoln. In 1861, he went to the National Peace Convention in Washington as the delegate from Connecticut, and he prepared the Minority Report for the Committee on Resolutions and supported Kentucky's application to Congresses to call a convention to propose amendments to the U.S. Constitution.     Baldwin died in New Haven on February 19, 1863 and was buried in Grove Street Cemetery.","Baldwin, Roger Sherman. <I>Notes on law taken from the lectures of the Honble.

Also, from 1820 to 1823, Beers was a member of the Connecticut State House of Representatives where he served both as the Clerk in 1821 and as the Speaker of the House in 1823. After a brief term in the Connecticut Senate in 1824, Beers spent the next twenty-five years as the Commissioner of the Connecticut School Fund.    In May of 1824, the Connecticut General Assembly appointed Beers, along with his colleagues Thomas Day and Lemuel Whitman (both attorneys) to a committee whose purpose was to reprint the Revised Statutes of the state. They were given the power to edit for errors in the previous edition (printed 1821) and to update any changes to the laws, and improve the Index. This was published in November of the same year.

Bell of Concord, NH prior to attending the LLS.",,Member of the state constitutional convention of 1850,"James Bell was the son of Samuel Bell, a successful lawyer, judge, Governor, and United States Senator from New Hampshire.     Before attending the Litchfield Law School, Bell studied law with his brother Samuel D. Bell (later a judge of the Superior Court) of Concord, New Hampshire. Bell attended the Litchfield Law School in 1824. Upon completion, he returned to New Hampshire, where he passed the bar in 1825 and began a legal practice in Gilmanton.     Bell successfully negotiated water rights for New England manufacturing companies. The rapid development of manufacturing in the towns of Lowell and Lawrence Massachusetts, and in Manchester, New Hampshire depended completely on the water power of the Merrimac River. During the dry summer season, manufacturing was threatened by lack of water. Plans were developed for an extensive system of dams and reservoirs of the New Hampshire lakes to feed the Merrimac. These plans involved intricate legal problems in purchasing the necessary lands and rights. Bell was appointed to negotiate between the small landowners of the lakes region and the powerful mill companies as head of the Winnepesaukee Land and Waterpower Company. His success in obtaining the riparian rights for the great manufacturing companies assured the continued growth of New England mills.     Bell was also involved in New Hampshire politics, twice running unsuccessfully for the governorship, and serving in the New Hampshire House of Representatives in 1846 and 1850. In 1855, he was elected to the U.S. Senate.     In 1831, Bell married Judith A. Upham. The couple had five children, Mary, Eliza, Lucy, Dana, and Charles. Mary married Nathaniel White, president of the Boston & Maine railroad, and Charles became a respected lawyer and judge himself.    He died in Laconia, New Hampshire May 26, 1857, the same day as South Carolina Senator Andrew P. Butler. He was interred in Exeter Cemetery in Exeter, NH.

As a boy, Boardman was educated under private tutors, and at age 16, he enlisted in the Continental regiment of Colonel Charles Webb. In March 1776, during the Revolutionary War, he was stationed in Long Island but his regiment left in October when the British took over the city. Boardman suffered from poor health and spent much of the war bed-ridden with a fever.     After the end of the Revolution Boardman trained as a clerk in New Haven, Connecticut, and then returned to his hometown of New Milford where he began a mercantile venture with his brother David in 1781. The brothers' business thrived and through a network of trade offered goods from Europe and India to the local market. To accomplish this, an intricate pattern was utilized in which local agricultural goods, received in trade or purchase, were shipped to New York and sold at a premium. Boardman would then bring back to Conneceticut rum, molasses, and a large variety of textiles to sell in the local market. This proved very successful and he continued his mercantile pursuits into the 1810s.     In 1795, Boardman had begun to expand his property holdings when he became a member of the Connecticut Land Company, one of the purchasers of the Connecticut Western Reserve (now part of Northern Ohio). Through this transaction he had become the owner of a large amount of real estate, standing second on the tax list of New Milford at the time of his death.    In addition to his business pursuits, Boardman was active in local and state politics after 1800. He became a member of the State Lower House of Representatives and served from 1803 to 1805 and again in 1816. He was elected to the State Upper House in 1817 and continued to serve until 1819 when he was elected to the Connecticut State Senate. In 1821 Elijah Boardman was elected to the United States Senate as a Democratic Republican, where he served from March 4 of that year, until his death in 1823.    In 1792, Boardman married Mary Anna Whiting. They had six children. Two of their sons, Wililam Whiting Boardman and George Sherman Boardman, attended the Litchfield Law School. Two daughters, Caroline Boardman Schroeder and Mary Anna Boardman, attended the Litchfield Female Academy.     At the age of 63 Elijah Boardman passed away on August 18, 1823 on a trip to Ohio to visit his son. His body was returned to Connecticut and he was interred at the Center Cemetery in New Milford.

Bradley was born on August 28, 1804 in Litchfield, Connecticut to Major Bradley and Chloe Hulbert Bradley. Edwin grew up on his family's farm and received a childhood and formative education, before attending the Litchfield Law School in 1827. He entered the law office of Beers & Sanford, at Litchfield, reading law for two and one-half years and attending lectures at the law school of Judge Gould. Edwin suffered from health problems and he felt compelled to leave Connecticut. In 1835, he moved to Sandusky, Ohio, to work in farming and agriculture. Presumably, due to the Bradley Family's longstanding military service, Edwin applied to work with the military in Ohio. At the beginning of the Mexican American war, he commenced recruiting a company of men for service. He lead this company to Camp Washington, where it was organized as Company F, with Bradley as Captain and they were assigned to the First Ohio Volunteer Infantry. He commanded Company F until it was mustered out of service at New Orleans, June, 1847. After the war with Mexico, Edwin became a mercantile trader in Williams County Ohio and moved to Stryker, Ohio in 1856. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Bradley recruited a Company that was attached to 14th Ohio Regiment. During this period of service he was promoted to the rank of Colonel and, at the expiration of his Company's service, he raised soldiers to form the 38th Ohio Volunteer Regiment (known as the Williams County Regiment). Due to failing health, Col. Bradley resigned in Feb. 1862. He had been married three times, but his last wife was Kate Russel Bradley. He had at least three sons; all were of age to serve, and took part in the Civil War. ","<I>Catalogue of the Litchfield Law School</I>, Hartford, CT: Press of Case, Tiffany and Company, 1849, 22.

Represented the state of Vermont before the U.S. Continental Congress to appeal for statehood in 1779. ,"Stephen Row Bradley was born in Wallingford, Connecticut. His parents were Moses and Mary Bradley, members of prominent New England families who had arrived from England in the 17th century. Bradley spent his childhood in Wallingford and was prepared for college by Reverend John Foot. He attended Yale and graduated in 1775. While at Yale in 1774, he published an almanac for 1775. Aside form the standard almanac, it also contained a poem and an index of herbal remedies. Bradley taught school after his graduation while also attending the Litchfield Law School.     When the Revolutionary War began, Bradley embarked on a military career. In 1776, he commanded a brief term company of Cheshire volunteers who served with distinction, and worked briefly as an adjutant and a quartermaster before becoming aide-de-camp the following year to General Wooster. From 1778 to 1779 he served as a Commissary and Military Major. During this time, Bradley became friends with eminent surgeon Dr. Andrew Graham and fellow Law School graduate Aaron Burr.    Bradley moved to Westminster, Vermont in 1779. He studied law, and later practiced law there. In fact, shortly after his arrival in Westminster he was called upon to fill in for a missing defense counsel at a public in a bitterly contested trial. General Ethan Allen and his soldiers were on hand acting as guards for the prisoners. Allen was so impressed by Bradley's abilities that he engaged him to be his lawyer from then on.     He soon became an important citizen of the town and held the positions of register of probate and town clerk. He also served as a county judge in 1783 and served for seven years in the Vermont House of Representatives in the 1780s. He served as Speaker of the Vermont House during 1785. He also served as a judge of the Vermont Superior Court during the 1780s.    Bradley published <I>Vermont's Appeal to the Candid and Impartial World</I> to bolster Vermont's request for statehood in 1779. Bradley was also an active member of the Commission which settled a dispute with New York State and consequently allowed Vermont to become the fourteenth state after the original thirteen colonies. When Vermont became part of the United States on March 4, 1791, Bradley and Moses Robinson were elected by the state legislature to be the first people to fill Vermont's two senate seats. Bradley entered the United States Senate in 1791 and supported the anti-administration faction. He was defeated for reelection in 1794.    Bradley returned to Westminster and was active in law and local politics, serving on the town council. He was again elected to the United States Senate for Vermont in 1800, as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party and reelected in 1807. He served as President pro tempore of the Senate from 1801 to 1803 and from 1807 to 1809. During this time, Bradley became close with President Thomas Jefferson as Bradley filled in to lead the Senate when Vice President Burr, angry at having lost to Jefferson, refused to fill the role. Bradley was also later close to President James Madison.    While serving in the Senate, he consistently counselled against war. But against his firm beliefs, the country entered the War of 1812. Disappointed in his country's inability to remain at peace, he retired from the Senate, and also politics, in 1813. He returned to Westminster and lived there again for five years.    Bradley was married three times, first to Merab Atwater (with whom he had 1 son, William Czar Bradley), then to Gratia Thankful Taylor (with who he had Stella Czarina Bradley, Stephen Row Bradley II, and Adeline Gratia Bradley). His last wife was Melinda Willard Bradley, who bore him Louise Agnes Bradley and Mary Row Bradley.    In 1818 he moved to Walpole, New Hampshire where he lived for the rest of his life and died. His body was returned to Westminster, Vermont, to be buried in the Westminster Cemetery.",[We are currently working to update and confirm citations of attendance.],,"Dexter, Franklin Bowditch. <I>Biographical Sketches of the Graduates of Yale College with Annals of College History, Vol. 3. </I> New York: Henery Holt and Company, 1903.  <br>Hall, Benjamin H. <I>History of Eastern Vermont. </I>New York: D.

His grandfather, Robert Breckinridge was a Captain in the French and Indian War. His father, also John Breckinridge, was an early settler of and prominent politician from Kentucky who had a county in the state named after him, and resided at their family home, 'Cabell's Dale.' His father died when he was only nine years old and his older brother became his guardian.   <br>In 1818 Breckenridge graduated from Princeton College after only three years of study. He then went on to study law at the Litchfield Law School. After completing his law studies however, Breckinridge became a minister despite considerable opposition from his family. Even before his studies at the law school, Breckinridge had shown an interest in theology. From 1819 to 1821, he had been both a tutor at Princeton and a student in the Theological Seminary.   <br>On August 1, 1822, he was licensed to preach in New Brunswick, New Jersey and on September 10, 1823 he was ordained in Kentucky. Breckinridge was a lifelong opponent of New School Presbyterianism and he held various ministries and offices during his lifetime.   <br>In 1826, he served for a short time as the minister of the Second Presbyterian Church in Baltimore, Maryland. He also served as a minister in Lexington, Kentucky and was famous for his religious debates published in the 1830s. While in Lexington, he often spoke out against what he believed to be the liberalism of President Horace Holley of Transylvania University.   <br>Breckinridge wanted to be a foreign missionary but poor health prevented him from doing so. In 1831, he acted as the Secretary and General Agent of the Board of Education of the Presbyterian Church. Breckinridge ventured into teaching in 1836 when he was appointed a Professor of Pastoral Theology at Princeton Seminary. In 1838, he relinquished that office in order to become the Secretary and General Agent of the Board of Foreign Missions. He acted in this position for two years until his health began to increasingly fail. Breckinridge then accepted another ministry at the Presbyterian Church in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1840. In 1841, he was chosen to be the President of Oglethorpe University in Georgia. However, he died not long after while spending time at his family's estate Cabell's Dale in Lexington, Kentucky.

Reeve married Aaron's sister, Sally Burr. After graduation, Burr traveled to Bethlehem, CT, and studied theology with Joseph Bellamy. After concluding he was not suited for a career in religion, he came to Litchfield as Reeve's pupil and his first law student. In 1775, Burr left his law studies in Litchfield and joined the Continental Army, and served until 1779 during the Revolutionary War.     After the close of the war, Burr returned to his legal aspirations, passing the New York Bar in 1782. He quickly became a leading political figure in New York, serving a year in the State Assembly from 1784 to 1785. Rising fast, he became the Attorney General of New York from 1789 until 1790, and was then elected to the United States Senate, serving from 1791 to 1797. Next, Burr opted to run against Thomas Jefferson for the Republican candidacy in the 1800 presidential election; during this race Burr tied Jefferson in votes. The decision came down to the House of Representatives who voted him the Vice President under Jefferson.     Aaron Burr's life and reputation took a sharp turn towards infamy when, during his term as Vice President, he shot and killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel. Although dueling was a common method of settling disputes at the time, it was illegal and participation was frowned upon by those serving in America's highest offices. On July 11, 1804, Hamilton was shot at Weehawken, NJ. The public outcry for justice was immense and Burr was formally charged for murder in both New Jersey and the state of New York. Yet, (presumably) due to serving in such a high office, he never faced trial in those states. Still, many threats were leveled toward Burr and he was forced to retreat to South Carolina in the middle of his term, only to return to Washington weeks later in order to finish his Vice Presidency.     In 1807, Burr attempted to raise an 80-man militia on Blennerhasset on the Ohio River, in present day West Virginia. He was indicted by President Jefferson for treason; being accused of heading a complex conspiracy plot against the United States which claimed Burr was attempting to raise an army in order to take over a piece of Mexican territory now in an area of Texas. Once acquired, Burr would then rule over the land as a dictator of his own nation state. This land actually included part of the U.S. owned Louisiana Purchase, which made seizing it (or plotting to do so) an act of treason. Although Jefferson wanted a treason conviction, Burr was acquitted by Justice John Marshall due to a lack of evidence by the prosecution. Burr's acquittal was a landmark ruling that upheld our Constitutional law, protecting the rights of citizens accused of treason. Burr's public and professional image was so badly tarnished by his treason trial that he opted to move to Europe in 1808. He waited four years before returning to New York in 1812. Burr practiced law for the remainder of his life and fell into relative obscurity until his death in Staten Island, New York on September 14, 1836.

While Aaron Burr served in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War, he met Theodosia while Washington's army encamped at her home, The Hermitage, in July 1778. The couple kept up a frequent correspondence that sparked controversy as she was still married at the time. Theodosia was highly educated and noted for possessing a sharp wit, frequently discussing the works of Rousseau, Voltaire, and Mary Wollstonecraft in letters exchanged with Aaron. Many consider her letters a display of early feminist thought. Theodosia's first husband James Prevost died in Jamaica in 1781 while in service. On July 2, 1782 she married Arron Burr. They had four children, but only one, Theodosia Bartow Burr,  survived infancy.

Calhoun,,John Caldwell Calhoun,M,,Abbeville,SC,United States,"March 18, 1782","March 31, 1850",Graduated from Yale College in 1804.,South Carolina in 1807,,Chairman of the Committee on Finance from 1845-1846.,,"John C. Calhoun was born in South Carolina, March 18, 1782. He spent his youth and formative education in South Carolina and moved north to attend Yale, graduating in 1804. Calhoun entered Litchfield Law School in 1805 and was admitted to the bar in 1807.     He chose to return to South Carolina and was elected a member of the state house of representatives for a year 1808-1809, running as a Democratic Republican. In 1810, Calhoun wrote a letter of introduction to Tapping Reeve informing him that William Martin proposed to attend his 'much valued' Law School. Calhoun provided character information and went on to thank Reeve for the advantages derived from his instruction.     From 1811-1817, Calhoun served in Congress. While there, he backed Speaker of the House Henry Clay in backing an act of war against Great Britain in 1812 along with other southern 'warhawks.' Following the war, aware of how close the country had come to defeat, Calhoun maintained an interest in the military. He sought to maintain a powerful military, opposing troop reductions and helping to establish two more military academies in the country.    President James Monroe appointed Calhoun the Secretary of War, a post he filled from 1817-1825. In 1820, he wrote a letter of witness and traveled to appear in court to support the pension claim of a Litchfield Revolutionary War veteran, Daniel Fenn. As Secretary of War, Calhoun also supported Monroe's plan to resettle all Native Americans west of the Mississippi River, though many refused to go.    Calhoun made his next bold political move in 1824, when he ran in the presidential elections and he was chosen Vice President of the United States under President John Quincy Adams. Calhoun's politics opposed that of Quincy Adams.    Four years later, Calhoun was reelected Vice President of the United States (in 1828) under President Andrew Jackson, serving from March 4, 1825 to December 28, 1832. Calhoun's politics aligned in many ways with Jackson's, and he was able to secure funding to force the remaining Native American Peoples, the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Chickasaw People, to move west.    Tensions arose in 1831 when Calhoun's wife, Floride, began the 'Petticoat War' that divided the Jackson cabinet around a societal scandal. Calhoun clashed with President Jackson and many members of the president's cabinet for over a year. Eventually the impasse was broken by Martin Van Buren, but the damage to Calhoun's relationship with Jackson was permanent.    One of the other major differences the two had, however, was over slavery and the right of states to nullify federal laws. Calhoun believed that states could nullify federal tariffs if they chose. In 1828, he authored an essay titled 'The South Carolina Exposition and Protest' in which he argued that states could veto any federal law that encroached on the power of the state. In 1832, this theory was questioned through the Nullification Crisis. Calhoun opposed a protective tariff (called the Tariff of Abominations) that would benefit the industrial North while compromising the slave-holding South. Calhoun was eventually mollified with the creation of the Compromise Tariff by Henry Clay that lowered the tariff. This disagreement encouraged Calhoun to resign from office and pursue a career in the Senate.    Calhoun was reelected to the Senate for a full decade, until stepping down on March 3, 1843. He attempted another presidential bid, but once again failed.    President John Tyler appointed Calhoun the Secretary of State from 1844-1845 but, once again, he was elected to fill a vacancy in the Senate. In these Senate years, Calhoun was an active, important, and controversial figure. He opposed the Mexican-American War, as he believed that an American victory would unbalance the union. Following the war, the extension of slavery was a contested topic and deeply divided the government. This extended to the eventual admission of California as a free state, which Calhoun also opposed.     He served in the Senate until his death in Washington, D.C. on March 31, 1850. In his last address to the Senate, a few weeks before his death and already greatly weakened by tuberculosis, Calhoun warned that the unless slavery was permanently and thoroughly protected by the government, the Union could not survive.","<I>Litchfield County Bar Association Records</I>, 1805, Helga J.

Calhoun had just graduated from Yale and was visiting his extended family there. Floride was an attractive and well-connected South Carolinian. The couple married in 1811, the same year Calhoun was appointed to Congress.    Floride also intelligent, stubborn, and possessed a strong sense of morality which she balanced with an amiability that drew Calhoun to her. She was devoutly and deeply religious, a lifelong Episcopalian. She was also an accomplished pianist and passionate about music.    She excelled as the wife of a powerful Washington politician and became one of Washington's most popular hostesses. She was close with President Monroe who had appointed her husband his Secretary of War. In the spring of 1820, the Calhoun's infant daughter extremely ill and the President broke established protocol to visit Floride and the baby every day.    In 1831, Floride was the center of the 'Petticoat War' that divided the cabinet of President Andrew Jackson. She had snubbed Peggy Eaton, wife of the then Secretary of War John Eaton. Although Peggy was a favorite of the President, she had a dubious reputation and hailed from a modest background. Floride, therefore, refused to return Peggy's calls, causing several other cabinet wives to follow her. Since her husband was the Vice President at the time, it put him in an awkward position, and President Jackson, who was very close to Peggy, was angered. The 'Petticoat War' divided the cabinet for over a year until Martin Van Buren broke the impasse.    Floride and John had ten children, five sons and five daughters (three of whom died in infancy). Following her husband's resignation as Vice President, Floride returned to the couple's South Carolina plantation, Fort Hill. She remained there until after her husband's death (in 1850). In 1854, she sold the plantation to her eldest son and moved shortly thereafter to a smaller house in Pendleton, South Carolina. In this time, six of her seven surviving children also died.    Floride died in July, 1866 and is buried in Pendleton, South Carolina, near her children.",,,"'Floride Bonneau Colhoun Calhoun.'

He died February 5, 1840 in New York City. In 1786, he married Mabel Ruggles (1761-1844). Their children were Henry Judson, Julia Elvira, Elizabeth Hannah, and Caroline Emma. Henry J. Canfield (1789-1856), graduated from Yale College in 1806, studied at the Litchfield Law School in 1808, and was admitted to the bar in 1810.

532,George Catlin,,,M,,Wilkesbarre,PA,United States,"July 26, 1796","December 23, 1872",,1819,,,,"George Catlin’s father had been born in Litchfield and trained as a lawyer at Litchfield Law School. His father later became a frontiersman and moved to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania where George was born in 1796. George met trappers, hunters, explorers and settlers who stayed with his family on their travels west.     At age 17, Catlin was sent to Litchfield to study law which he disliked. George preferred to read about natural history, science, arts, Indians and to sketch fellow students and local scenery. After two years of study in Litchfield, George entered the Bar of Luzerne County in Pennsylvania. He practiced law for two years before he “resolved to convert my law library into paint pots and brushes.”     In 1823, Catlin studied art in Philadelphia and established himself as a popular portraitist in Washington, D.C. and Albany, NY. After meeting a tribal delegation of Indians from the western frontier, Catlin became eager to preserve a record of Native American customs and individuals. In 1830, George Catlin traveled to St. Louis where the explorer General William Clark helped him make contact with Native Peoples. Catlin traveled for years in North and South America, painting and sketching hundreds of portraits, scenes of villages, religious rituals, games, and Native Americans at work. He stimulated an interest in the cultures of Native Americans, and he publicly exhibited his work in Europe and the United States.     George Catlin appealed to the U.S. government to purchase his collection to create a Museum of the West in 1836. In 1847, he asked Congress to include his work as part of a bill they were considering to establish the Smithsonian Institution. However, the outbreak of the Mexican War caused Congress to deny the purchase. In 1852, Massachusetts Senator Daniel Webster supported the purchase of Catlin’s collection calling it “more important than all the other drawings and representations on the face of the earth.” The bill was defeated by one vote due to the lobbying of anti-Indian Southern Democrats. Catlin’s entire work and life was motivated by his desire to obtain recognition for the dignity and highly developed cultures of Native Peoples and his deep interest in natural history.    Instead of showing his paintings in the Smithsonian, then, Catlin created his 'Indian Gallery,' which he traveled with along the Eastern Seaboard and into Europe. This continued from 1837 to 1850. In 1852, he was forced to sell his personal collection of over 600 paintings, the entirety of the Indian Gallery, to pay his debts. Industrialist Joseph Harrison purchased the collection and had it stored. Catlin spent the remaining twenty yeras of his life trying to reconstruct his collection based on his sketches from the 1830s.    His work was never purchased by Congress, but it was privately donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 1871. Catlin also contributed to the knowledge of his era in 1844 by publishing <I>Manners, Customs, and Conditions of the North American Indians</I>, <I>Catlin’s North American Indian Portfolio</I>, <I>My Life Among Indians</I> (published in 1867), and <I>Shut Your Mouth and Save Your Life</I> (published in 1891).

He also studied with Judge Noah Benedict in Woodbury CT, and with Nathaniel B. Smith and Truman Smith.",Chariman of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1833-1834 and in 1836. ,,"John Middleton Clayton was the descendant of Joshua Clayton, a Quaker who had come with William Penn to Pennsylvania. His father's parents were James and Sarah (Middleton) Clayton. While Clayton was a boy his family moved to Milford, Kent County, DE. He attended academies in Berlin, MD and Lewes and Milford, DE. Clayton graduated from Yale with highest honors and during his junior year there had delivered an oration on 'Military Glory.' After attending the law school and passing the bar, Clayton began a law practice in Dover, DE as well as a long and prominent career in the Delaware government. Clayton was elected the Clerk of the State House of Representatives of DE. At first, due to 'family' influence, he was a member of the Federalist Party but he later became a Whig. During this time he married but his wife died in childbirth in 1825 and both of his sons would die unmarried. On December 21, 1826, he was appointed the Secretary of State of Delaware by Governor Paynter. Governor Polk reappointed him in that position until he resigned in 1828 to enter national politics. He supported John Quincy Adams in the Presidential Campaign of 1828 and on March 4, 1829 he was elected to his first term in the U.S. Senate. When he was elected, he was the youngest member of the U.S. Senate. This was the beginning of Clayton's prominent federal political career. In 1830, he gave a powerful speech on Foot's resolution and was instrumental in leading the reform and reorganization of the Post Office. During his first term as a Senator, he also supported President Jackson in his campaign against nullification but did not support his bank policies. In February 1833, Clayton avidly promoted Clay's Compromise Tariff. He was an ardent protectionist and aided Henry Clay in the passing of the Tariff Bill of 1833. Clayton also acted as the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1833 and wanted to resign from the Senate in 1835 but was reelected. However, Clayton resigned from the Senate in the fall of 1836 to become Chief Justice of Delaware and also received an honorary law degree from Yale that same year. Clayton had remained actively involved in his home state of Delaware and in November of 1831 he served as a member of the Delaware Constitutional Convention and helped to revise the state constitution. Clayton resigned as Chief Justice in 1839 to campaign for President Harrison. Nevertheless, his loyalty to Henry Clay led him to refuse to become Harrison's running mate in 1840. He moved from Dover to New Castle in 1842 where he shortly set up practice as a lawyer. Clayton soon reentered the national political arena with his election to a second term in the U.S. Senate in 1845. During this time, he supported General Taylor for President in 1848 leading to a permanent rift with Henry Clay. Taylor then appointed Clayton Secretary of State in 1849. Clayton opened trade with the Orient and established the treaty that Commodore Perry used on his expedition to Japan. However, his most recognized achievement as Secretary of State was his negotiation of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty with the British Government. This treaty helped the United States avoid war with England, provided for a neutral international canal across Central America, and forced Great Britain to withdraw from territories it had occupied in Central America. President Taylor died before the Treaty went into effect and Clayton resigned his post. Clayton was then reelected to a third and final term in the U.S. Senate. He went on to defend the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty against those who were attacking it. He died during a Congressional recess in Dover, DE. ","Houghton, Josiah. 'LLS Law Notebook 1817-1818.'

He worked in Litchfield and New Haven, CT; Bennington, VT; and Troy and Binghamton, NY. Thomas and Elizabeth Collier were Litchfield residents from 1784 to 1808. Times in Litchfield were difficult for the family. As a printer, the income Thomas generated was often insufficient to cover the expenses of his business and 11 children. Additionally, a history of illness often prevented Collier from publishing his newspaper, the Monitor as often as expected. While this newspaper was only one of many items printed by Collier, it was the object of much community support. In a time of partisan rancor, many of the town’s leading citizens were Federalists and welcomed a venue in which to voice their opinions. One such Federalist was Tapping Reeve, who, in an 1803 edition of the Monitor, printed a letter attacking Thomas Jefferson. A lawsuit resulted in which Jefferson sued Reeve, who was indicted along with Collier, for libel. Collier spent time in prison in 1806 as a result. Despite petitions to raise money on his behalf by citizens such as Julius Deming and Frederick Wolcott, his financial woes continued and he was confined to debtor’s prison. In 1808, Collier petitioned the state for an Act of Insolvency to release him from his debt. His petition was granted. The Colliers eventually settled with a son in Binghamton, NY in 1827.

Joel was educated at schools in Savannah and Augusta, GA and then was under the tutelage of Nicholas Ware of Augusta, GA who had attended the Litchfield Law School in 1792. While attending Litchfield Law School, Crawford traveled back and forth from Georgia to Litchfield on horseback, a trip that took six weeks. After attending the law school, Crawford returned to Georgia and was practicing law in Sparta, GA by 1808. He then moved to Milledgeville, the state capital of Georgia at the time, and was a partner with the father of a fellow law school student L.Q.C. Lamar. In 1812, Crawford joined the army where he served as a lieutenant and aide-de-camp to General Floyd. He twice had his horse shot out from under him at the battles of Atosse and Cauleebee Swamp. At the close of the war, he returned to Milledgeville and began a career in politics. He then married and spent the majority of his time on his plantation near Blakely, GA. In 1826, he was appointed to the Board of Commissioners that determined the boundary between Georgia and Alabama, one which has stood without revision until this day. In 1837, he was appointed by the state to act as a commissioner for the construction of state-owned Atlantic and Western Railroad. He was eventually named President of the Board. Crawford even traveled to England to buy rails. After the death of his wife, Crawford moved full time to his plantation where he died.

His father had come to America serving as a British soldier prior to the Revolution but when the war broke out, he became a patriot. After the outbreak of the war, Croghan's father served with a Virginia militia unit. In 1784, he was commissioned to survey public lands in Kentucky where he remained and opened a land office in 1791. He later married Lucy Clark, sister of William Clark of the Lewis and Clark expedition. The couple had eight children.    Locust Grove was a prosperous home and farm. Major Croghan and his wife owned 30 to 45 slaves. On November 9, 1806, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark stopped at Locust Grove as they returned from their three year exploration of western North America. In 1819, President James Monroe and General Andrew Jackson visited the home which had become a focal point of local politics and society due to the prominence of the Croghan family. Jackson would return in 1825 for another visited, and Aaron Burr, former Litchfield Law School student, was also a visitor.    William Croghan, Jr. was a well educated man who attended Transylvania Seminary and Dickinson College, before studying under Judge Reeve in Litchfield, Connecticut. Finding little happiness in the study halls of Transylvania Seminary, Croghan, with the persuasion of his brother John Croghan, attended Dickinson College. There he received a extensive scientific education, one similar to his brother who stayed in the medical field. This would not be the case for William Croghan, Jr., who seemed to enjoy business and politics much more. Anxious to have him trained to help him in his multiple business interests, his father then sent him to the Litchfield Law School in 1814. Being an ambitious twenty four year old who recently graduated from Reeve's law school, Croghan hoped to obtain a position in a foreign embassy as Secretary to the Legation, but was never granted the position. Croghan then returned to Kentucky in 1817 to work for his father. In 1819, Croghan settled in New Orleans where he worked as a lawyer, served his father's business interests, and ran a cotton plantation. It was there that he met and befriended artist and naturalist James Audobon. Until 1822, he traveled frequently, spending time in Louisville, New Orleans, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia.    In 1821, Croghan married the wealthy Mary O'Hara of Pittsburgh. The couple lived near Louisville and had two children. Tragically, Mary died in 1827 and the couple's young son died in 1828. After these deaths, Croghan moved his surviving child to Pittsburgh, PA. Where, in 1830, he built a grand home for his three-year-old daughter and himself. The house still stands. Croghan was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar in 1835.    In 1842, Croghan's only remaining daughter, Mary (1827 - 1903), eloped from her boarding school in New York at the age of 15 with a Captain of the British Army who was 43 at the time. Croghan was a widower at the time and reportedly suffered a stroke upon hearing the news. He demanded action be taken against the couple and asked the Pennsylvania General Assembly and the United States Government to intercede. He also managed to have his daughters considerable wealth (an inheritance from her mother and her maternal grandfather) withheld from the couple, though eventually he had a change of heart and visited them. Upon his death in 1850, Mary received her full inheritance and became a beloved Pittsburgh philanthropist until her own death in 1903.","Handwritten list by William Samuel Johnson, 'Catalogue of the Students at Law in the school at Litchfield Conn. at & after Aug. 15th 1817..', Connecticut Historical Society, Johnson Family Papers, 1722-1863, Box - Johnson Papers; Catalogue of the Litchfie",,"Samuel W.

It is unclear exactly when the engagement was broken but letters between the two indicate that Maria was not as interested in Virgil as he was in her. A letter from Tapping Reeve consoling Maria on her decision indicates that the break may have come in 1807.     While still engaged, Virgil Maxcy's friend and Brown and Litchfield Law School classmate Lemuel Williams wrote to him on December 24, 1808 -- a week before his own wedding to Sarah Smith:    'I dwell with particular delight on the circumstance that the wife of my bosom will be the friend of my dearest Virgil.'     'O! my Virgil! How ardently I wish that we might all meet together, you & your Maria, I and my Sarah, in the bonds of wedded love, to pass our days in each others vicinity; in the constant interchange of friendship. But such a prospect is too, too blissful for realization. But we may, & I trust shall, often meet in <U>the Good Land of Steady Habits</U>, when for a season we can enjoy the flow of love.'

He later moved to Liberty County, GA where he pursued a poltical career. Cuthbert served for four terms in the GA House of Representatives in 1811, 1813, 1817 and 1832. He also acted as an officer of the militia in the War of 1812. Cuthburt was twice married. His first wife died without children. His second wife was Louisa E. Croft. They went on to have seventeen children. In addition to his state political career, Cuthbert also served in the U.S. Congress. He returned to state politics however and was appointed Secretary of the Georgia Senate. He was a leader in politics but ran for the U.S. Senate again and lost. His loss was in part due to a long standing political feud in Georgia between Robert Clarke and Robert Troup that lasted twenty five years. Cuthbert was appointed by Presdient Monroe in 1822 a commissioner to treaty with the Creek and Cherokee Indians. As a member of the Clarke faction, while the Troup faction held power in GA between 1823 and 1833, Cuthbert could not get elected as a Senator. A new political alignment in 1833 put his brother Albert in the U.S. Senate. In 1830, Cuthbert moved to Mobile, LA where he again practiced as a lawyer. He spent the rest of his life in Mobile and after he retired from the judicial bench his law practice grew. Cuthbert lived to be the last survivor of the 16th Congress and of the Princeton class of 1804. He died on Mon Louis Island, near Mobile, LA.

Two months later, on December 29, 1820, Cutler noted, 'Little Taylor, you remember him — he is mentioned in orator Ogilvies book as a rare specimen has killed himself for the love of Miss Swift.'     [All we know of Taylor is that he passed the bar in 1820 and died soon after.']    Emily Noyes Vanderpoel, Chronicles of a Pioneer School from 1792 to 1833: Being the History of Miss Sarah Pierce and her Litchfield School (1903) pp. 201, 205.     In 1820, Litchfeld Female Academy student Mary Ann Wolcott was romantically attached to Litchfield Law School student Henry Walter Livingston, whose family belonged to the old NY grant, Manor families (considered the closest thing to “aristocracy in the US”). Despite Mary Ann's own distinguished background ( it didn't meet the Livingston family's marital criteria and Henry ultimately ended the relationship. This caused a stir in the community and many students weighed in on the breakup via journal entries and letters.     Upon Henry’s arrival at Litchfield Law School, Cutler wrote that Henry saw Mary Ann (his first glance of her?) and fellow student 'Hannah L' from his window at Tapping Reeve’s house and remarked, “I suppose these young ladies i.e. the ladies of this village -- depend upon law students for their husbands -- I will be very careful they do not ensnare me.”     Within three weeks, Henry was “engaged” to Mary Ann:     In Cutler's “Journal” dated September 2, 1820:   “Engagements are dangerous affairs -- ‘reason’ & love take little company together now-a-days -- love easily takes possession of a man, but an engagement connected with delay is apt to cool it & when the passion is moderated, it is easily ousted by reason -- & too often by something which ought to have less effect than reason.”     Emily Noyes Vanderpoel, Chronicles of a Pioneer School from 1792 to 1833: Being the History of Miss Sarah Pierce and her Litchfield School (1903) p.197.     Cutler believed “it was probably the interference of friends who have caused the mishap” between Livingston and Mary Ann and that 'avarice' was prejudice against her economic and social standing. “...[T]hat is a very dishonorable reason considering his already monstrous estate... if I was an Emperor I would hang such a man.”     Emily Noyes Vanderpoel, Chronicles of a Pioneer School from 1792 to 1833: Being the History of Miss Sarah Pierce and her Litchfield School (1903) p.197.     It was also rumored that Livingston rejected Mary Ann as vengeance. Cutler wrote: “Hunt Stone surmises that L. cheated M.A.W. to revenge an insult of that kind once offered to one of his Uncles by one of her Aunts.”     Emily Noyes Vanderpoel, Chronicles of a Pioneer School from 1792 to 1833: Being the History of Miss Sarah Pierce and her Litchfield School (1903) p.203.     According to Culter, Tapping Reeve said that if gossip of Livingston “disappoint[ing] 6 ladies” prior to Mary Ann was true that “the wretch ought to be prosecuted.” In this period lawsuits could be brought against men who broke engagements. Cutler believed Frederick Wolcott should sue Livingston. He wrote, “M.A.’s feelings may be nice upon the point but her delicacy ought not to prevent his punishment especially since her family is not rich.”     After the “cruel affair,” Culter said Livingston was leaving for France and wrote “It has been reported that L. says ‘he will go to Europe with a light heart.”     Emily Noyes Vanderpoel, Chronicles of a Pioneer School from 1792 to 1833: Being the History of Miss Sarah Pierce and her Litchfield School (1903) p.198.     In 1823, Livingston married Caroline de Grasse de Pau in France. She was the granddaughter of the fabulously wealthy Comte de Grasse, who had been the commander of the French Fleet during the decisive battle at Yorktown in the American Revolution.     Four years later, in 1827, Mary Ann married Asa Whitehead, a lawyer of Newark, NJ and close friend of her sister Elizabeth’s husband.     George wrote in his “Journal” about some surprisingly licentious behavior in Litchfield:  “Walter S. Franklin, Esq., says there was kissing done at Charlotte Landon’s wedding -- singular for so stiff & prudish a place as L...Miss Mary Ann thought she was near being swallowed at the kissing bout which has been held in L... They say Helen was all but kissed to death at the Landon’s.”    Emily Noyes Vanderpoel, Chronicles of a Pioneer School from 1792 to 1833: Being the History of Miss Sarah Pierce and her Litchfield School (1903) p.203; 207.",,Lawyer;Political Office,New Haven/CT/United States;Watertown/CT/United States;New York/NY/United States;Venus/IL/United States,"Local/Postmaster//Venus, IL;Local/Commissioner/of the County/Hancock County, IL","Mary Ann Monson Whitney/May 29, 1821",1819,,George Younglove Cutler album;Mary Ann Lewis papers,

He graduated from Yale College in 1797.","Hartford, CT in December 1799",,,,"Thomas Day was a sixth generation descendant of Robert Day of Hartford, Connecticut, born in England in 1634 and one of the first settlers of Massachusetts as well as an early settler of Hartford with Rev. Thomas Hooker. Thomas Day's parents were Rev. Jeremiah Day and his third wife Abigail Osborne Day.    Day's education began with instruction in Latin and Greek by his father and brother. He studied at an academy in New Milford and then graduated from Yale College in 1797. Day then attended the Litchfield Law School. After leaving the law school, he took his brother's place as a tutor at William's College for one year and read the law with Daniel Dewey. He then moved to Hartford in September of 1799 where he studied further under Theodore Dwight.     In 1805, Day began to attend sessions of the Connecticut Supreme Court and took notes to report on decisions. This experience would later lead to his appointment as the first reporter of the Supreme Court of Connecticut in 1814, a position he held until 1853. Consequently, Day published <i>Reports of Cases, Argued and Determined in the Supreme Court of Errors, of the State of Connecticut</i>, an extensive work consisting of two series of 26 volumes published between 1802 and 1853. He also published a digest of this work from 1786 to 1838 and well as an 1813 digest of cases in several courts of the United States. Day also worked as an editor of the Public Statues of Connecticut in 1808, 1821 and 1824 as well as several English law books. Finally, Day was the author of the <i>Concise History of the Judiciary of Connecticut</i> published by the Connecticut Historical Society.     In 1821, at the May session of the General Assembly of Connecticut , members passed a revised 'Crimes and Punishments' law. Zepheniah Swift, Lemuel Whitman, and Thomas Day, the three legal scholars who drafted the act at the legislature's request, had placed in section 14 a miscarriage clause that was without precedent in the United States. This clause was the first time that an American legislature had addressed the question of abortion in statute form, and it declared illegal the particular method of poisoning to induce abortion.     Despite his busy political and legal career, Day was involved with many charitable institutions, largely in relation to education. He served as a trustee at the Hartford Female Seminary, the Hartford Grammer School, the Retreat for the Insane, and the American Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb. Day also worked as the Director of the Connecticut Bible Society and as the president of the Hartford County Missionary Society, the Connecticut Branch of American Education Society and the Goodrich Association. Day also established a scholarship at his alma mater, Yale, in 1832 for the descendants of the Rev. Jeremiah Day.    Day was also the founder of the Connecticut Historical Society in 1825 and became the President when it was reorganized in 1839. Several years later, Day received an honorary degree from Yale in 1847.     He and his wife had eight children. Day died in Hartford, CT. ","'Moothall Society Record Books.'

If every case in law were to be studied upon the basis of reason and justice, the .... lisation (?) would be more pleasant, but a great part of our law is founded, not in the nature of things, nor on any positive statute of the legislature, but merely upon the narrow, technical notions of judges who sat on the English bench some centuries ago. After one sett of errors was introduced, another sett was soon found necessary as order to preserve the symetry of the legal system. As error is always crocked, that very chinck stone which was put in to stop one gape in the wall soon pushed out of its place, and made a hole the other side. Fictions (?) were then thrown in, like shrub oak bush, to repair the break. Now as Courts of Law are regulated by precedents, all these matters must necessarily be attended to. The Lawyer must follow the Courts, and in this may spend his life in collecting triffles that load the memory without pleasing the fancy, or improving the understanding.'

In January of 1763, his brother Jonathan died and left Day a farm where Day then settled and where he married his first wife, Sarah Mills. While living and working on the farm, he managed to continue his academic interests as well as prominent positions in the local community (that of selectman of the town and a deputy to the General Assembly of the colony in 1767). When his first wife died, he returned to his religious studies and became a licensed preacher in September 1767.    In 1769, he moved to the parish of New Preston where he was ordained pastor in January 1770 and established himself there. From there, Day embarked on several missions, one to western Vermont (1788) and another to the Delaware settlements in New York, to the Susquehanna in Pennsylvania (1794).

He graduated from St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore, MD in 1806 and then attended the Law School. DeMenou was admitted to the bar in Maryland on May 23, 1809. In 1843, DeMenou lived in Baltimore, MD and by 1856 he was residing in Paris, France. From a letter to Samuel Fisher from the French Ambassador's office in 1941, 'Comte Charles de Menou was Charge d' Affaires of the French Kingdom to the United States from May 1822 to August 4, 1824 when he was replaced by Baron de Mareuil, who came as minister Plenipotentiary.'","Catalogue of the Litchfield Law School (Hartford, CT: Press of Case, Tiffany, and Company, 1849), 7.",,,"Catharine Beecher 'Reminiscences' Autobiog. of Lyman Beecher, vol. 1, p. 166 'When Mrs. Stowe was at Paris, she was repeatedly visited by an aged French gentleman, Count _____, who in youth had spent some years at Litchfield as a student at the law school. His family was exiled in the first Revolution, and he had been placed there to be educated at the bar. Although since his return he had moved in the highest circles, yet, in conversation with Mrs. Stowe, he dwelt with enthusiasm on the society of Litchfield, which he declared was the most charming in the world.'     DeMenou was credited with returning the Charles WIlson Peale portrait of George Washington to the United States:    'The National Gallery owns the full-length portrait of Washington, by Charles Willson Peale, which hangs in the Capitol. It is one of the repetitions of Peale's original portrait of the president, painted for the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania, from sittings in Philadelphia in 1778, and now in the possession of Mr. Thomas McKean. The canvas in the Capitol bears the date 1779, and the signature of the artist. Its early history has never been satisfactorily explained; but it was evidently sent to Europe to be sold, probably in the same year that it was painted. It was brought back to this country from France by Julius, Count de Menou, from whom it was purchased, in October, 1841, by Mr. Charles B. Calvert, of Prince George County, Maryland, for the sum of two hundred dollars. The latter placed it in the National Institute in Washington, and in 1862 it was turned over to the Smithsonian Institute. It was sent to Philadelphia in 1876 for the Centennial Exhibition ; and remained at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts until 1881, when it was recalled to the Smithsonian, and lent to the Corcoran Gallery of Art. A claim to ownership of the picture by Titian R. Peale, a son of Charles Willson Peale, was decided adversely by the Board of Regents in 1873; but in 1882 Congress appropriated $5,000 in settlement of the claim, and the portrait was transferred to the Capitol.'   See http://www.oldandsold.com/articles34/art-treasures-15.shtml",,,"'I believe it is the wish of Mr. de Neuville that Count de Menou should remain here some time as chargé d’affaires, and perhaps eventually to succeed him. The Count desires it very much himself, and I believe no person more acceptable to the government could be sent. I understand that the President will write to you on this subject. I believe we are principally indebted for the commercial convention to the friendly disposition of Mr. de N. for this country. He has certainly had the arrangement of the difficulty much at heart, and I hope will continue to interpose his good offices to render permanent the provisional arrangement, with such modifications as experience may render necessary.

Devereux studied at the Litchfield Law School but did not seek to actively pursue the practice of law until financial losses forced him to pursue the profession. While Joint Reporter of the North Carolina Supreme Court, he published four volumes of law reports and two volumes of equity reports. From 1820 to 1827 Devereux acted as a Trustee for the University of North Carolina. Following the death of his wealthy uncle George Pollock in 1839, Thomas’ mother inherited his assets, and Thomas left his career to take charge of managing the estate. He continued to be active in politics, and as a Federalist advocated a strong Union, opposing State’s Rights doctrines. However, throughout the War years, he gradually abandoned these views. Thomas lived for many years at his plantation 'Conneconara' on the Roanoke River in Halifax Co, NC. He died there at the age of seventy-six in March 1869.    Thomas was married twice. He and his first wife, Catherine Ann Johnson, had twelve children, but only one son and six daughters survived to maturity. Of note, their daughter Catherine Edmondston wrote the published 'Journal of a Secesh Lady' during the Civil War, and much can be learned of the family in her writings. Her mother, Thomas' first wife, died on July 17, 1836 in White Sulpher Springs, VA. Devereux remarried shortly afterwards. He and his second wife, Ann Mary Maitland, had one daughter.

His family moved to New York in 1806 and settled in Guilford, NY where his father became a farmer of moderate means. As a child, Dickinson was apprenticed to a clothier and studied Latin and mathematics on his own. For five years he taught in public and private schools, studying law and surveying at the same time. He also read law in the office of Clark and Clapp in Norwich, NY. During this time Dickinson married. Unlike many law students, Dickinson attended the Law School as a married man and without having gone to college first. He was admitted to the bar the following year and served as a lawyer and postmaster in his hometown of Guilford, NY for a short time. He soon moved to Binghamton, NY in 1831 where he became a prominent member of the Democratic party. He rose through the local and state ranks. In 1844 he attended the Democratic National Covention in New York and cast his vote for James Polk. Later that year, Dickinson was appoointed by Gov. Bouck to fill the Senate seat of N.P. Tallmadge. He was reelected in 1845 and served for six years. As a Senator, Dickinson spoke on the annexation of Texas, the occupation of Oregon, the Mexican War and offered opposition to the Wilmot Proviso. He retired from Congress in 1851 and returned to his law practice. When President Franklin Pierce nominated him to be the Collector of the Port of New York in 1853, he declined, hoping instead to receive the Democratic nomination for President in 1860. He did not receive enough votes at the convention to be nominated. When South Carolina seceeded from the Union, he felt the North was responsible and strove for reconciliation. After Fort Sumter, however, Dickinson vigorously supported the Union government and made hundreds of speeches encouraging young men to enlist. Later, Dickinson sought a Republican nomiantion to the U.S. Senate but lost. He declined an appointment to the Northwest Boundary Commission and a seat on the Court of Appeals. In 1864, he was a delegate to the Union Convention, but lost the candidacy for Vice President. He died in New York City. ",,,"Dickinson, John S., ed.

As one of the first lawyers in the area, he wrote in a letter to his family that his legal practice supported him well. After Edwards married Louisa Maria Morris in Springfield, VT, the couple returned to Ohio in 1807 and Edwards built them their own house. They had three sons, only one survived them. Edwards also fought in the War of 1812 as a Colonel and when Ohio received statehood he was elected to U.S. Congress in the first congressional election in the state.

Ellsworth worked as a lawyer and also pursued agricultural interests. From 1819 to 1821 he acted as President of the Aetna Insurance Company and was also active in real estate. In 1832, President Andrew Jackson appointed him the Commissioner to and Superintendent of Indian Settlement. This commission involved the transplantation and resettlement of Native Americans from their homes to the south and west and Arkansas. While in this position, Ellsworth traveled extensively in this region. On one of those tours in eastern Oklahoma, he was accomapnied by the author Washington Irving. In April 1835 he was elected Mayor of Hartford but resigned on June 15, 1835. Ellsworth was then appointed by President Andrew Jackson as the first U.S. Commissioner of Patents, and consequently he presented a series of reports to Congress. His office was also very involved with the development and distribution of seeds and made the first government investments in agriculture. He was also influential in getting a government appropriation of $30,000 for his friend Samuel B. Morse to see the practicality of the telegraph. On April 30, 1845, Ellsworth resigned as Commissioner of Patents. He then moved to Lafayette, IN as the agent for the purchase and settlement of public lands, eventually becoming the largest landholder himself. Reportedly, Ellsworth was the first to use a mowing machine on the prairies. In 1847, his wife Nancy died from a fractured leg at the age of fifty-four. Ellsworth remarried twice after that.

During the Revolution, Oliver Ellsworth was frequently involved in delegations to create a new nation. He represented Connecticut at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 and made his presence known as a significant mediator to the sometimes stressful and chaotic debates.

John Foot, a minister in Cheshire, Connecticut and Abigail Hall, the daughter of John Hall, Esq. also of Cheshire. He was the youngest member of the Yale Class of 1797, entering at the age of only thirteen. He studied at the Litchfield Law School at the relatively young age of seventeen. However, due to poor health and headaches he found to be exacerbated by studying, he abandoned the study of the law to take up a more 'active' profession.     Foot left Litchfield for New Haven, Connecticut and found employment there in the shipping trade centered around Long Wharf. He became a West India Trader and went on many voyages for his health. The War of 1812 Embargo Act destroyed his business and Foot returned to his father's home in Cheshire where he spent the rest of his life working as both a farmer and a politician.     Foot was very active in the public life of Connecticut. He was involved in the Toleration Party which wanted a new state constitution. He ran for Governor of Connecticut in 1824 but was defeated. While a United States Senator, he introduced a resolution (called the Foot Resolution) regarding the sale of public lands which led to the famous Webster-Hayne debate.     He resigned from Congress in 1834 to run again for the Governor of Connecticut, this time successfully. He was not reelected however and finally retired from politics. He died in Cheshire in September, 1846.    Foot married Eudocia Hull in 1803 and the couple had seven children. One son, John Alfred Foot, also attended the Litchfield Law School and became a politician. Another son, Andrew Hull Foot (also spelled Foote), attended West Point and later joined the Navy where he served with distinction. He was an outspoken abolitionist and served as a rear admiral during the American Civil War until his sudden death in 1863.",[We are currently working to update and confirm citations of attendance.],foot_samuel_a.jpg,"Foote, Abram W.

Foote also entered the political arena and was affiliated with Ambrose Spencer, the New York State Attorney General and future mayor of Albany (1825-26). Foote was appointed assistant Attorney General by Governor George Clinton in 1801 and served for several years. He continued his legal practice in Troy until he relocated to Albany in 1808 where he resided until his death.

After attending Litchfield Law School, he practiced law in Troy, NY with David Buell. While in Troy, Fullerton began to engage in the buying and selling of real estate and in 1833 he moved to Chicago to expand his real estate operations in that rapidly growing city. Real estate speculation atracted many lawyers of the period. Their legal skills were needed to deal with deeds and titles and the frequent litigation which arose in areas of rapid development. Usually starting by being employed as a lawyer for a speculator, many young lawyers saw their field as an oppotunity to enter land speculation on their own. The fact-growing areas of the West attracted many young lawyers seeking fortune in real estate speculation. Known as the 'pioneer' real estate developer of Chicago, Fullerton made a tremendous fortune. He owned and developed large tracts of lad on the northwest side of the city. Fullerton Avenue, Chicago's longest street, which runs for twenty miles, was named for him, as was Fullerton Park and the Fullerton River. He also became interested in Michigan lands and owned lumber interests there. Memorial Hall of the Art Institute of Chicago was named for him.

His early education at the common schools was hampered by his poor eyesight. Nevertheless, Gould entered Yale in 1787 and eventually graduated with High Honors in 1795. While at Yale, he worked as a tutor and studied law with Judge Chauncey in New Haven. After college, he worked briefly as schoolteacher in New Haven, CT and then in Wethersfied, CT and Baltimore, MD before comming to study at Litchfield Law School in 1795.  <br>Gould studied with Tapping Reeve for several years. His wife, Sally McCurdy Tracy was the eldest child of Uriah Tracy, a Litchfield Law School graduate and U.S. Senator. Three of their sons would the Litchfield Law School, and eight of his nine children would survive him.   <br>Gould settled in Litchfield with his wife and when Tapping Reeve was appointed to the Supreme Court of Connecticut in 1798, he asked Gould to work as a fellow instructor at the law school. Gould and Reeve worked together for many years and Gould constructed a second law school building on his property in North Street to accomodate the growing numbers of students who came to Litchfield to study the law.   <br>When Reeve was forced to retire in 1820 due to his increasing forgetfulness and poor health, the Litchfield law School was left solely in the hands of Gould. Before the retirement of Reeve, Gould had maintained his law practice outside of his teaching, but in 1820, he began to concentrate all his efforts on lecturing at the Law School. Like Reeve, Gould was apointed to the Connecticut Superior Court, however, he was turned out by a political 'revolution' in Connecticut in 1818 that put the Federalist party out of power.   <br>Gould maintained the Litchfield Law School until 1833 when his own failing health as well as his grief over the death of his son forced him to close the school. He was a preeminent teacher of the law in that period and was widely recognized by his legal colleagues as a critical scholar and excellent teacher.

He graduated from Yale in 1816 and then studied at the Litchfield Law School in 1818, as did two of his brothers - George Gould and James Reeve Gould. Gould was admitted to the bar in Litchfield, Connecticut in September 1820 and moved to Clinton, Georgia in 1821.   <br>At this time, Georgia offered many opportunities for a young and enterprising lawyer. In 1823, he moved from Clinton to Augusta, Georgia, where he lived and practiced law for the rest of his life. In February 1851, he was elected as a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas, later known as the City Court of Augusta. Inspired by his experience in Litchfield, Gould established a law school in Augusta, Georgia in 1833 which was modeled after Tapping Reeve and his father's lecture-style teachings. Prior to Gould's efforts, there was no similar movement for such an institution south of Virginia. pThe law school flourished for many years and was not suspended until 1854, upon the death of his eldest son.   <br>Gould's first marriage was to Mrs. Anna Gardner McKinne on October 7, 1824. They were married for thirty-six years and had three children - James Gardner Gould, Julia Tracy Gould, and Henry Cummings Gould. His second marriage was to Virginia Highbie Hunter, the daughter of Wimberly J. Hunter of Savannah, GA, on September 20, 1964. During their eighteen year marriage William and Virginia had three sons - William Hunter Gould, Wimberly Gould, and George Glenn Gould.   <br>Despite his New England heritage, Gould acted as a Confederate commissioner for the state of Georgia during the Civil War. Gould also commanded a local company in the Confederate service, which was composed of elderly men and was known as the 'Silver Grays'. This company was not expected to appear on the battlefield, but did guard duty at home over Federal prisoners and other local service.   <br>Aside from his professional and civic duties Judge Gould was profoundly interested in Masonry, and had in that order a most distinguished record. On December 6, 1825, he was initiated as an entered apprentice in Social Lodge, No. 1. He quickly rose in position, and for a number of years he held the position of High Priest of Augusta Chapter, No. 2. He was Grand Marshal of the Grand Chapter of GA from 1829 to 1846, and Grand High Priest for several years. He became a member of the Georgia Commandery, No. 1, Knights Templar, on March 18, 1826, and was elected Grand Commander of the State in 1860, which position he held until 1868.  <br>On July 18, 1882, at the age of eighty-three years old, William Tracy Gould passed away in his longtime community of Augusta.

He was a direct descendant of the Abraham Hasbrouk who emigrated to America from the German Palatinate with his brother in 1675 and was one of the original twelve patentees of the 65,000 acre New Paltz patent in Ulster County. His Parents were Judge Jonathan and Catharine [Wynkoop] Hasbrouk. He and wife Julia Frances Ludlum had two sons and four daughters. After he was admitted to the bar in 1813, he set up his law office in Kingston and later formed a partnership with Charles H. Ruggles in 1817, one that lasted for many years. In 1833, Hasbrouck became partners with Marius Schoonmaker, who had once been his law student.    One of the most prominent cases of Hasbrouck’s career was him and his partner representing civil rights and women’s suffrage activist, Soujoiner Truth in the case that reunited her and her son. Truth had been working for Hasbrouck and his family as a domestic servant. Truth’s son had been sold to a family in Alabama, separating the two of them. Hasbrouck and his partner Schoonmaker took up her case, free of charge, and represented her in court. As a result, Truth became the first free black woman to win a case regarding the return of a child from a white family.    Abraham became the first President of the Ulster Bank in 1831. He also had a great interest in education and in 1840 became the first ever President of Rutgers College that was not a minister. Hasbrouck received tenure in his 10 years in office. While there, he taught rhetoric, constitutional law, and political economy. He also added modern languages to the Rutger’s curriculum, and expanded their science department.While he was President of the college, he received two honorary degrees, one from Columbia and the other from Union. In 1859 Hasbrouck became the first President of the Ulster County Historical Society. He died on February 23, 1879 and was the last survivor of the Yale class of 1810.

He was the architect of Tryon Place.   <br>After attending the Litchfield Law School, Hawks became a reporter of the North Carolina Supreme Court for six years and published four volumes of <I>Reports.</I>   <br>In 1826, he left the law to study for the Episcopal ministry. After being ordained in New Bern in 1827, he became the assistant minister at Trinity Church, New Haven, CT. He then served at St. James Church in Philadelphia before accepting a position as Professor of Divinity and Theology at Washington College (now Trinity College in Hartford, CT).   <br>In 1831, Hawks moved to New York City and took an appointment as rector of St. Stephen's Church. His sermons attracted large congregations and he was eventually offered $1500 a year to join nearby St. Thomas Church. His reputation and oratory ability grew and the galleries of St. Thomas overflowed each Sunday. His Bible classes averaged 100 students.   He served as Historiographer of the Episcopal Church of the United States, became a noted editor and author and opened a classical school for girls in Flushing, NY. In 1833, Hawks salary rose to $3000 a year making him the highest paid clergyman in the United States.   <br>Hawks continued to participate in other church affairs, as well. In 1832, he was appointed assistant secretary to the House of Deputies of the General Convention of the Episcopal Church. In 1833, he took a part-time post as Professor of Ecclesiastical History and Pulpit Eloquence at the General Theological Seminary. The following year, Hawks was named secretary of the New York diocesan convention in New York City. In 1835, the General Convention named Hawks 'Conservator of all books, pamphlets and manuscripts of this church.'  <br>Hawks's interest in history led him to London in 1835. There he copied important historical documents, which he used as material for a two-volume work on the church history of Maryland and Virginia. He also wrote some nine titles under the pen name 'Uncle Philip' for the publishers Harper & Brothers, which appeared in their Harper's Boy's and Girl's Library imprint series  <br>Hawks wrote and published material on general church affairs. In 1837, he partnered with Reverend Caleb S. Henry to put out a magazine called the <I>New York Review.</I> The publication, a response to the <I>Unitarian North American Review,</I> lasted for a few years. Afterward, Hawks helped start <I>The Church Record</I>, a journal of Christian education, in 1843. This was followed in 1853 by <I>The Church Journal.</I>  <br>In late 1838, Hawks became one of many targets of a trend among the American penny press to expose the alleged vices of holy men. The accuser was George Washington Dixon, a man best known for his blackface music act, who claimed that Hawks was engaging in sexual affairs. Hawks charged Dixon with libel on December 31, 1838. After a heated trial, Dixon pled guilty however it is believed that Hawks, seeking to avoid a lengthy trial paid Dixon off at the time. Dixon himself claimed as much in 1841. Only a few years later, another scandal erupted closer to home. Hawks had opened a boys' school in 1839 in Flushing, Long Island. The school had financial difficulties and was failing within three years, and Hawks was accused of mismanaging the funds. This proved one scandal too many. Hawks resigned from St. Thomas Church on October 21, 1843.  <br>Over the next decade, Hawks bounced from church to church. He first moved to a church in Holly Springs, Mississippi, on the American frontier and far from the disgrace of New York. There he went to work starting another school. At the Mississippi Diocesan Convention of 1844, Hawks took center stage due primarily to his endeavors to create a Diocesan school. When the Convention called for the election of the Diocese's first bishop, Hawks was tapped. His episcopal confirmation at the General Convention was protested, with James Quarterman, a painter from Flushing, NY, alleging that Hawks had over $100,000 in outstanding debt due to financial mismanagement at St. Thomas.   <br>Though Hawks successfully defended himself and the General Convention expressed their support for him, they discharged his consent back to the Diocese of Mississippi. In the end, Hawks turned the post down. He instead moved to Christ Church in New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1847, he was named the first president of the University of Louisiana, known today as Tulane University. Then in 1849, he returned to New York City to pastor Calvary Church. He stayed there until 1862. Hawks declined most non-clerical appointments during his time at Calvary, including an election to the Rhode Island episcopate in 1852 and a professorship at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1859. He continued to write, and in 1855 and 1856 he co-authored the <I>Narrative of the Expedition of an American Squadron to the China Seas and Japan</I> with Commodore Matthew Perry.  <br>During the American Civil War, Hawks moved to Calvary parish in Baltimore, Maryland. By 1861 he was editing again, this time with William Stevens Perry on the <I>Journal of the General Conventions.</I> He began as editor of <I>Documentary History of the Protestant Episcopal Church</I> in 1863 and held the post until 1864. He later gave the endowment for St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery Chair of Ecclesiastical History at the General Seminary. He returned once more to New York City in 1865, where he helped to start the Chapel of the Holy Saviour on 25th Street. Another project was a Spanish-speaking church called Iglesia de Santiago, where Hawks preached on occasion.   <br>Hawks died on September 26, 1866. He is buried at Christ Church in Greenwich, Connecticut.","Josiah Houghton, LLS Law Notebook 1817-1818, <I>Catalogue of the Officers and Students of the Law Institution, Litchifeld, Cont.</I> Helga J.

In 1800 Homer studied law at Tapping Reeve's school in Litchfield, Connecticut and after he was admitted to the bar in 1801 he moved to Canfield, Ohio where he established himself as the first lawyer in the Western Reserve. In 1806 he relocated to Youngstown, Ohio where he practiced law until his retirement at age sixty. Mr. Hine's political career included being elected four times to the office of Representative with the Ohio legislature.

During their marriage Homer and Mary had eight children. The family regularly attended the local Presbyterian Church, and Mr. Hine was active in the abolitionist movement. After Homer's death on July 14, 1856, his wife Mary continued to live on their homestead until 1872 when she moved to Painesville to live with one of their sons. She passed away in 1882.

Staples.,,,"Samuel Johnson Hitchcock was the son of Benjamin and Mary [Johnson] Hitchcock. He was born the oldest of twelve children. Since his father had very little money for his education, Hitchcock was first trained as a mechanic. However, he had a great love of reading and education and attracted the attention of his pastor, the Rev. Azel Backus who helped prepare him for college. He graduated as the valedictorian of his class at Yale in 1809. After attending the Litchfield Law School, he worked as a tutor at Yale for the next four years until he resigned in 1814 and consequently passed the bar in New Haven. In 1815 he entered practice in New Haven. His first wife, Laura Coan, died fourteen years after they married from contracting consumption. They had five children. His second wife, Narcissa Perry Whittemore, died eleven years after they married while on a trip to Southport. In 1820, Hitchcock became associated with Seth Staples as a teacher in his private law school. He divided his time equally between his legal practice and his teaching. Hitchcock and Staples were instrumental in the founding of the Law School of Yale College. Staples moved to New York City in 1824, and left Hitchcock in charge of his law school with Judge Daggett who assisted him in his teaching. From 1824 until his death, teaching at the law school was his most important job. That same year, Yale began to publish names of law students in its annual catalogue of students. Two years later Daggett was named a Professor of Law by Yale, even though Yale did not award a Bachelor of Law degree until 1843. In 1830, Hitchcock was made an instructor in law by Yale, even though his law school still remained separate. However, in 1846, a formal act of the Yale Corporation made the law department a branch of the college. Hitchcock was renowned by his students as an effective and inspiring teacher, whose lectures were often attended by many students of disciplines other than law. He often used examples from history and literature in his classes. From 1837 to 1840, he was the President of the Hartford and New Haven County Railroads. He received an honorary degree from Yale in 1842. At the time of his death in 1845, he was working to establish a railroad between New Haven and Albany.","Hitchcock, Samuel J., Notes at Judge Gould's Law School, Litchfield, 1809 (Connecticut Historical Society, MS 80220)",Judge Samuel Johnson Hitchcock.jpg,"Hitchcock, Mrs. Edward, Sr. The Genealogy of the Hitchcock Family.

He later studied at Union College in 1828.",NY in 1831,,,,"Ward E. Hunt was a descendent of Thomas Hunt who resided in Stamford, CT in 1650. His parents were Montgomery Hunt, a Cashier at the First National Bank of Utica, and his wife Elizabeth Stringham.     Hunt attended Oxford and Geneva Academies and in 1827 entered Hamilton College. He later transferred to Union and graduated with honors in 1828. He began his legal studies at the Litchfield Law School prior to his return to Utica, New York and entering the law office of Judge Hirman Denio. Hunt was admitted to the bar in 1831, but spent that winter in the south due to his poor health.     Upon his return to New York, he began a partnership with Judge Denio and they soon had a flourishing practice. He then married Mary Ann Savage of Salem, New York and they had two children. His second marriage was to Maria Taylor of Albany in 1853.     In 1838, Hunt was elected to the New York State Legislature as a Democrat and served one term. He opposed the annexation of Texas as well as the extension of slavery into the Northern territories. In 1822, Hunt was elected Mayor of Utica. However, as the controversy over slavery became fiercer, Hunt eschewed his earlier political leanings and instead supported the candidacy of Martin Van Buren of the Free Soil Party for President in 1848. Hunt also was instrumental in the organization of the Republican Party in New York in 1856.     In the late 1840s, he ran for the New York Supreme Court but was defeated, supposedly by the Irish vote because he had successfully defended a policeman charged with the murder of an Irishman. At the end of the Civil War, Hunt was elected to succeed his former partner Judge Denio on the New York Court of Appeals. Three years later in 1868, he became the Chief Justice of that same court. In the autumn of 1872, he was nominated by President Grant to the U.S. Supreme Court on the resignation of Justice Samuel Nelson. He took his seat on the court on January 9, 1873.     As a member of the Supreme Court, Hunt consistently sided with the Court majority (led by Chief Justice Morrison Waite) and upheld state regulations, bondholder claims, and police power. He also denied claims for racial equality under the fourteenth amendment. His earlier fight against slavery had been to prevent its extension into the Northern territories where white 'free-soil' farmers hoped to establish themselves without competition from large plantations worked by slave labor. His concern had not been for the welfare of the slaves or the abolition of slavery, but rather for the rights of white small farmers.    Some of the first cases that Hunt sat on were the famous <i>Slaughter-House Cases</i>. These were a set of three similar cases whose decisions were combined to become a crucial interpretation of the newly passed, and extremely contentious Fourteenth Amendment. This Amendment re-defined citizenship in the United States to include more African Americans (former slaves) and children of immigrants (legal or not). The <i>Slaughter-House Cases</i> were the first many important cases based on this Amendment, including <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> (1954) and <i>Roe v. Wade</i> (1973). The ruling in the <i>Slaughter-House Cases</i> was essentially that the federal government would protect the privileges of national citizenship of a person but it could not police the individual state's powers.    Hunt also sat at the trial of Susan B. Anthony in 1873, who had voted in New York during the 1872 presidential election despite the state constitutional requirement limiting the franchise to men. Anthony claimed that the state had denied her the privileges guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment. However, Hunt flatly denied her argument and invoked the <i>Slaughter-House Cases</i> (1873), which established the precedent that state regulations, however unjust, were under the absolute domain of the state. Anthony received a guilty verdict, Hunt refused to poll the jury, and fined Anthony $100. The sentence was not enforced, however, and there was no appeal.     After he suffered a paralyzing stroke in 1879, Hunt received much criticism for his refusal to retire from the bench, despite his inability to perform his judicial duties. His refusal was based on his desire for a full pension, which was only awarded after ten years of service and the minimum age of seventy years. On January 27, 1882, Congress passed a special act which allowed him to retire and still receive his pension. The passage of the act was conditional on his retirement within thirty days of its passage. He resigned on the day of its enactment.     Hunt died on March 24, 1886 in Washington, D.C.","<I>Catalogue of the Litchfield Law School</I> (Hartford, CT: Press of Case, Tiffany and Company, 1848), 23.

Despite Mary Ann's own distinguished background, it didn't meet the Livingston family's marital criteria and Henry ultimately ended the relationship. This caused a stir in the community and many students weighed in on the breakup via journal entries and letters.     Elizabeth suggested it was Livingston, “the Baron,” who was in pursuit of her sister and that Mary Ann had not courted his attention. In 1825, she wrote her fiancé and Litchfiled Law School student John P. Jackson:     “And so the poor Baron has been pouring forth his grief to you...I suppose we have sunk sadly in his estimation for slighting so much worth! I do indeed feel quite sorry his feelings are so much wounded, but his attentions were so troublesome in our family it became necessary to give him some hint for our own comfort. We could seldom walk in the streets unless he joined us; but he appeared particularly to single Mary Ann out as the subject of his attentions, & when any ride or walk was proposed, he always intruded his company upon her, sometimes even when his name was not mentioned in the invitation, & this gave rise to remarks by no means agreeable to her.”     Elizabeth remarked that Livingston felt slighted when he wasn’t invited to a tea the sisters gave at their house.     In 1823, Livingston married Caroline de Grasse de Pau in France. She was the granddaughter of the fabulously wealthy Comte de Grasse, who had been the commander of the French Fleet during the decisive battle at Yorktown in the American Revolution.     Four years later, in 1827, Mary Ann married Asa Whitehead, a lawyer of Newark, NJ and close friend of her Elizabeth’s husband.

He was born at Brecon, Wales on September 28, 1781. In 1784, Jones traveled with his parents to Philadelphia to make arrangements to bring the entire family to America. A few years later, the family moved to Vincennes, then located in the Northwest Territory (in the present day state of Indiana).  <br>As a young man Jones attended Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. He then studied medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, but soon after beginning the practice of medicine formed a dislike for the profession and decided to pursue the study of law. He began his legal studies at the Litchfield Law School in Litchfield, Connecticut, and after completing his studies moved to the town of Kaskaski in the Indiana Territory (located in present day Illinois). It was there that he opened a law office and began a political career with the Anti-Harrison political faction.  <br>In 1808, Jones was nominated a Randolph County candidate for the Indiana Territory General Assembly. As a member of the Anti-Harrison camp and a Divisionist he supported slavery and breaking the Territory up into smaller territories or states. This proved successful the following year with the creation of two separate Territories - Indiana and Illinois.   <br>In August of 1808, in a volatile era of politics, Rice Jones was challenged to a duel by a member of the Pro-Harrison camp, the Hon. Shadrach Bond (an ex-representative in the Territorial legislature, afterward a delegate in congress representing the Illinois Territory, and the first Governor of the State of Illinois). Upon being challenged, Jones accepted. He named pistols as the weapons and at the appointed time Jones and Bond, along with their seconds, met on an island in the Mississippi River between Kaskaskia and St. Genevieve to commence their duel.  <br>At the time of the duel Jones's gun fired into the ground near his own feet, and Jones and Bond settled the issue between themselves with no harm. Following the duel a series of letters were published in an area newspaper, the <I>Vincennes Western Sun</I>, by Dr. James Dunlap (Bond's second in the duel), Rice Jones, and other individuals in their political circles. These letters indicate a disagreement upon the events leading up to the duel and also show the animosity that existed between the two opposing political factions at the time. As the year progressed, tensions between Dr. Dunlap and Jones grew and on December 7, 1808 James Dunlap shot Rice Jones on the street in Kaskaskia, causing Jones's death. Dr. Dunlap was indicted for murder, but was never tried as he had left the Indiana Territory before the time of the trial.

","The historical record on the Bond-Jones duel and the circumstances surrounding Rice Jones's death are varied. Early written histories suggest that Jones accidentally fired his gun at the time of the duel, thus allowing for the peaceful resolution of the duel without Bond taking his shot at Jones. These histories hold that Bond's second, Dr. James Dunlap, was insistent that Jones had purposefully fired his weapon and that Bond should have been allowed to take a shot at Jones. These theories claim that the incident led to ill feelings between the two men and Dr. Dunlap murdered Rice Jones in Kaskaskia, avoiding trial by fleeing the territory before a trial could take place and abandoning his wife and son.   <br>New research suggests that these early histories may be biased by political leanings and support the theory that Jones may have indeed fired his pistol purposefully at the time of the duel. This research concludes Dr. Dunlap shot Rice Jones in self-defense in Kaskaskia after being threatened with a dagger. This theory supports the argument that while Dr. Dunlap left the Territory and avoided trial for murder he did not abandon his wife and child, but was instead forced to leave them behind to preserve his innocence and avoid a wrongful conviction.",,,,,Lawyer;Political Office,Philadelphia/PA/United States;Vincennes/Northwest Territory/United States;Kaskaskia/Illinois Territory/United States,,,1807,,,
1421,John Rice Jones,,,M,,Mallwayd,,Wales,"February 11, 1759","February 1, 1824","Attended the University of Oxford in Oxford, England and afterward took a regular course in both medicine and law.",,,,Indiana Territorial Legislative Council in 1805; Missouri State Constitutional Convention in 1820,"John Rice Jones, son of John Jones, Esq., was born in Mallwayd, Wales on February 11, 1759. He received a collegiate education at the University of Oxford in Oxford, England and afterward took a regular course in both medicine and law. It was during these courses that Jones determined to pursue a career in law and after completely his courses he established himself in the practice of law in London. On January 8, 1781 in Brecon, Wales Jones was wed to Eliza Powell, a native of London. During their six year marriage the couple had four children.   <br>In February of 1784 Jones and his family left England and set sail for the United States, locating in Philadelphia where he promptly began his legal career on American soil. After two years of living in Philadelphia Jones decided to head west and relocated in Louisville, then in the colony of Virginia (in the present day state of Kentucky). In September of 1786, while residing in Louisville, John Rice Jones joined the militia under the command of General George Rogers Clark, and fought with the unit to suppress the Wabash tribes of Native Americans. It was during this time of service that he was appointed Commissary General of the Vincennes Garrison. On March 11, 1787 Eliza passed away in Vincennes, leaving the couple's four children under the care of their father.  <br>In 1791, after completing his military service Jones received from the U.S. government a grant of one hundred acres of land for his services in the militia. Also in 1791 Jones remarried. On February 11 he wed Mary Barger, with whom he would spend the remainder of his life and have eight children with. In the years following the acquisition of his land grant Jones continued to acquire real estate and he became an extensive land owner in the Northwest Territory (particularly the areas that would become the Illinois and Indiana Territories). While building his share of land Jones continued on with his legal profession in Vincennes and his abilities began to gain him recognition among politicians in the area.  <br>In 1801 John Rice Jones was commissioned by Governor William Henry Harrison to serve as Attorney General of the recently established Indiana Territory. He continued on in that role until the date of his appointment as a member of the Territorial Legislative Council in 1805. Also in 1805 Jones was elected from Knox County to serve in the House of Representatives for the Indiana Territory, which he did until the Governor permanently dissolved the General Assembly in 1808. After this action Jones and his family relocated to Kaskaskia, the seat of government of the newly formed Illinois Territory. Jones himself had briefly found himself in Kaskaskia several years earlier, and his son, Rice Jones, had located in Kaskaskia in the practice of law in 1806, and had become active in politics of the Territory with his 1808 election to the lower house of the General Assembly of the Territory.   <br>In Kaskaskia John Rice Jones continued his legal profession. Soon after arriving in the Territory however, his son, Rices Jones, was murdered, and only after two years of residing in Kaskaskia John Rice Jones, who had taken the loss of his son very heavily, decided to move his family west again. In 1810 the family moved to St. Genevieve in the Louisiana Territory (later the Missouri Territory), then onto St. Louis, and finally settled in Mine a Breton (later incorporated as the town of Potosi in the Missouri Territory). It was in Mine a Breton that Jones and his wife would remain for the rest of their lives. He also became engaged in the mining and smelting of lead ore in their new home. In 1820 Jones was appointed as a member of the convention that framed the first state constitution of Missouri. Following the convention Jones was appointed as one of the three Supreme Court Justices of the new state. On February 1, 1824 John Rice Jones died in St. Louis while still holding his office of Supreme Court Justice. His wife Mary passed away nine years later on January 6, 1839 in Potosi, Missouri.",,,"Mason, Edward G., Ed. <I>Early Chicago and Illinois</I>.

President Jefferson appointed Kirby as first Superior Court Judge of the Mississipi Territory on 6th April 1804. He went directly to his new post, Fort Stoddert, on the Alabama River north of Spanish-held Mobile and near the present Mount Vernon.

Lawrence's mother, Cornelia Beach Lawrence, was the daughter of the associate Rector of Trinity Church. William Beach Lawrence was born October 23, 1800 in New York City.    Lawrence graduated from Columbia College in 1818 with highest honors. He then studied law in Litchfield before leaving for Europe to study in law and political economy at the Sorbonne and Ecole de Droit. While there, he developed an interest in international law that continued throughout his career.    Lawrence was appointed as Secretary of Legation under Ambassador to Great Britain Albert Gallatin and, in 1827, he was made Charge d'Affaires in London. He returned to New York in 1829 and resumed practicing law. After returning to New York to practice, Lawrence continued to lecture and write on jurisprudence, public law and political economics. He was the Vice-President of the New-York Historical Society from 1836-45. In 1855, he published an annotated edition of Henry Wheaton's <I>Elements of International Law</I>, which became the standard textbook on the subject.     In 1850, he was elected Lieutenant-Governor of Rhode Island and briefly became acting governor following the death of the governor. He was not re-elected, possibly due to his unpopularity resulting from his fight to defeat a liquor prohibition law.    Lawrence was a strong believer in states' rights and, although he did not defend slavery, saw it as an economic necessity and denounced abolitionists as dangerous fanatics. He opposed secession at the outbreak of the Civil War but wrote numerous articles and books calling for the fair treatment of the South after the War. His political views earned him great unpopularity. However, he remained a well regarded internationalist and in 1868 published a four volume code of international law, <I>Commentaire sur les Elements du Droit International</I>.    Beginning in 1872, he began lecturing on international law at Columbia University and shortly thereafter began collecting honorary titles from Columbia, Georgetown, the University of New York, and Brown.    In 1873, he argued for the defense in the case of the steamship <i>Circassian</i> before a Joint High Commission in which he won a reversal of a Supreme Court ruling. His argument was published as <I>Belligerent and Sovereign Rights as Regards Neutrals During the War of Secession</I> became an authoritative exposition in both England and the United States of points of public law.    His wife, Esther Gracie, was the daughter of New York's leading merchant, Archibald Gracie. They married in 1821 and she accompanied Lawrence when he traveled to Europe shortly after they wed. The couple had three sons and two daughters. One of his sons, Albert Gallatin Lawrence, was a Brigadier-General and Minister to Costa Rica. One of his daughters married Baron von Klenck, a decorated hero of the Franco-Prussian war.

Henry Livingston and Caroline had ten children.","<I>Catalogue of the Litchfield Law School </I>Hartford, CT: Press of Case, Tiffany and Company, 1849.",,,"The Livingston House, named The Hill, in Columbia County, New York is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.     In 1820, Henry was romantically attached to Litchfield Female Academy student Mary Ann Wolcott of the “first family” of Litchfield Wolcotts. Mary Ann’s grandfather and uncle were Governors of Connecticut and her great grandfather was a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Her distinguished background, however, didn't meet the Livingston family's marital criteria and Henry ultimately ended the relationship. This caused a stir in the community and many students weighed in on the breakup via journal entries and letters.     Upon Henry’s arrival at Litchfield Law School, fellow student George Younglove Cutler wrote that Henry saw Mary Ann (his first glance of her?) and fellow student 'Hannah L' from his window at Tapping Reeve’s house and remarked, “I suppose these young ladies i.e. the ladies of this village -- depend upon law students for their husbands -- I will be very careful they do not ensnare me.”    Within three weeks, Henry was “engaged” to Mary Ann:    Abigail Lyman wrote to William Greene:    “Since I wrote to you there have been several new engagements in this place. Mary Ann Wolcott is engaged to Mr. Henry Livingston a very elegant man in appearance with two hundred thousand dollars and Lord of the Manor. He is not overstocked with sense but sufficient to please her, what a satirical remark.”    William replied to Abigail on July 13, 1820 that the engagement only proved love was irrational and unpredictable. Evidently a long engagement was planned, which raised a red flag for William: “You ask me if I think Miss M ___ W’s ___ sentiments capable of constancy for two long years. I confess I should doubt it if there happened an <U>occasion</U> for her changing them. ...If they love each other sincerely now, they had better tie the knot as soon as possible.”     GR Papers #168    George Younglove Cutler wrote in his “Journal” dated September 2, 1820:  “Engagements are dangerous affairs -- ‘reason’ & love take little company together now-a-days -- love easily takes possession of a man, but an engagement connected with delay is apt to cool it & when the passion is moderated, it is easily ousted by reason -- & too often by something which ought to have less effect than reason.”    Emily Noyes Vanderpoel, Chronicles of a Pioneer School from 1792 to 1833: Being the History of Miss Sarah Pierce and her Litchfield School (1903) p.197.    Cutler believed “it was probably the interference of friends who have caused the mishap” between Livingston and Mary Ann and that 'avarice' was prejudice against her economic and social standing. “...[T]hat is a very dishonorable reason considering his already monstrous estate... if I was an Emperor I would hang such a man.”    Emily Noyes Vanderpoel, Chronicles of a Pioneer School from 1792 to 1833: Being the History of Miss Sarah Pierce and her Litchfield School (1903) p.197.    It was also rumored that Livingston rejected Mary Ann as vengeance. Cutler wrote: “Hunt Stone surmises that L. cheated M.A.W. to revenge an insult of that kind once offered to one of his Uncles by one of her Aunts.”    Emily Noyes Vanderpoel, Chronicles of a Pioneer School from 1792 to 1833: Being the History of Miss Sarah Pierce and her Litchfield School (1903) p.203.    According to Culter, Tapping Reeve said that if gossip of Livingston “disappoint[ing] 6 ladies” prior to Mary Ann was true that “the wretch ought to be prosecuted.” In this period lawsuits could be brought against men who broke engagements. Cutler believed Frederick Wolcott should sue Livingston. He wrote, “M.A.’s feelings may be nice upon the point but her delicacy ought not to prevent his punishment especially since her family is not rich.”    After the “cruel affair,” Culter said Livingston was leaving for France and wrote “It has been reported that L. says ‘he will go to Europe with a light heart.”    Emily Noyes Vanderpoel, Chronicles of a Pioneer School from 1792 to 1833: Being the History of Miss Sarah Pierce and her Litchfield School (1903) p.198.    Elizabeth Wolcott suggested it was Livingston, “the Baron,” who was in pursuit of her sister and that Mary Ann had not courted his attention. In 1825, she wrote her fiancé and Litchfiled Law School student John P. Jackson:     “And so the poor <U>Baron</U> has been pouring forth his grief to you...I suppose we have sunk sadly in his estimation for slighting so much worth! I do indeed feel quite sorry his feelings are so much wounded, but his attentions were so troublesome in our family it became necessary to give him some hint for our own comfort. We could seldom walk in the streets unless he joined us; but he appeared particularly to single Mary Ann out as the subject of his attentions, & when any ride or walk was proposed, he always intruded his company upon her, sometimes even when his name was not mentioned in the invitation, & this gave rise to remarks by no means agreeable to her.”    Elizabeth remarked that Livingston felt slighted when he wasn’t invited to a tea the sisters gave at their house.     Fanny Lord, in her November 11, 1899 reminisces of the Litchfield Female Academy, noted that after the jilting of Mary Ann by Livingston “parents were even more careful as to any attentions paid to their daughters. Sometimes they even went so far that if a young man called three times on on one of them they would ask his intentions.”     Emily Noyes Vanderpoel, Chronicles of a Pioneer School from 1792 to 1833: Being the History of Miss Sarah Pierce and her Litchfield School (1903) p.289.    In 1823, Livingston married Caroline de Grasse de Pau in France. She was the granddaughter of the fabulously wealthy Comte de Grasse, who had been the commander of the French Fleet during the decisive battle at Yorktown in the American Revolution.     Four years later, in 1827, Mary Ann Wolcott married Asa Whitehead, a lawyer of Newark, NJ and close friend of her sister Elizabeth’s husband.",,,,,Political Office;Lawyer,Columbia County/NY/United States,State/State Representative//NY,"Caroline de Pau Livingston/February 20, 1823",1820,,,

His father was an inventor who, in 1806, ran a steamboat on the Savannah River and, in 1788, the state of Georgia hagave him the exclusive rights to the steam engine. Augustus was born in Augusta, GA, and was said to have weighed seventeen pounds at birth. Longstreet was sent to school in Augusta but was a poor pupil and did not enjoy school. After beginning his young education in Augusta, his father moved the family to the Edgefield District in South Carolina. After a few years however, Augustus was sent back to Augusta for more primary schooling. His roommate at the time, George McDuffie, was reportedly an intense student who was able to get Longstreet interested in learning.   <br>In 1808, he was sent to the Waddell School in Wilmington, SC where he boarded at the home of William Calhoun (the brother of John C. Calhoun). While later attending Yale, as well as the Litchfield Law School, Longstreet reportedly turned his Georgia accent into an tool for social success, and passed that advice onto many Southern 'yarns' with an exaggerated accent and provincial country manner. He told the types of tales which he would later become famous for in his <I>Georgia Scenes</I>.   <br>During all of his schooling, Longstreet was following in the footsteps of John C. Calhoun (the Calhouns being close friends of his parents). After his marraige to Francis Parke, a very wealthy woman, the couple moved to her home in Greensboro, GA, where Longstreet began to practice law. Their first child was born in 1820. Ultimately, six of their children died young and only two of their daughters survived to adulthood.   <br>In 1824, the deaths of several of his children caused Longstreet to withdraw from politics. Although he was nominated for the United States Congress in 1827, he experienced a religious conversion before the election and joined the Methodist Church; consequently giving up the contest for Congress.   In 1827, he briefly took over the <I>Augusta Sentinel.</I> Longstreet published his famous work <I>Georgia Scenes</I> in 1835 in book format (the tales had previously been a series of newspaper sketches). This work was very popular and Longstreet saw the stories as a source of the history of old Georgia. From 1834 to 1836, he acted as the editor/publisher of <I>Augusta Rights' Sentinel</I>. However, Longstreet soon left the world of publishing as well as his legal practice.   <br>In 1838, Longstreet entered the Methodist ministry and gave up his law practice the following year. He was appointed the President of Emory University in 1839. Longstreet also received an honorary degree from Yale in 1841. In 1844, Longstreet acted as an influential member of the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in New York, NY. This meeting led to the rupture between the northern and southern churches over the issue of slavery. In 1847, Longstreet published <I>A Voice from the South</I>, which presented a view against New England, a view that had been influenced and developed during his time in Litchfield. While in Litchfield, Longstreet was greatly influenced by the predominantly Federalist politics of New England. There was great opposition to the War of 1812 in New England, whereas in his home state of Georgia there was strong support for the war. Longstreet believed that many New Englanders opposition to the war and threats of secession were treasonous, even though his later belief in the right of individual states to secede reflected what New England had believed and he had opposed when he was at the Litchfield Law School.   <br><I>A Voice from the South: Comprising Letters from Georgia to Massachusetts, and to the Southern States</I> was published anonymously and offered a criticism of Northern attitudes on slavery. While the Litchfield Law School did not deal with the moral issue of slavery in its curriculum, Tapping Reeve several times defended runaway slaves. Longstreet was also greatly influenced by the sermons of Rev. Lyman Beecher about the importance of temperance in 1812, and he later became the leader of the early temperance movement in Georgia. Longstreet resigned from Emory in 1849 to become President of the Centenary College in Louisiana, but left shortly after taking the position. From 1849 to 1856, he served as the President of the University of Mississippi. In 1857, he was elected the President of South Carolina College and was also elected an honorary member of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.   <br>In 1861, the students at South Carolina College left in large groups to fight in the Civil War. Longstreet thus returned to Oxford, MS where his two daughters lived. While he had once been a strong advocate for secession, he began to urge for a compromise as the threat of war loomed. He was a man of great regard in the South, and opposed the war even though his own invective against the North may have contributed to Southern hostility. His home in Oxford was later burned by Union soldiers in 1862.","<I>Catalogue of the Litchfield Law School</I> (Hartford, CT: Press of Case, Tiffany and Company, 1849), 12.

1593,Edward Greely Loring,,,M,,Boston,MA,United States,"January 28, 1802","June 19, 1890",Graduated from Harvard College in 1821.,1824,,,,"Edward Greely Loring was the son of Edward and Francis (Greely) Loring. He practiced law for several years in Boston and was a partner of the noted educator and fellow Law School graduate Horace Mann.   <br>During his time on the Probate Court in Boston, Loring served as the judge in the famous Anthony Burns case. Burns was a fugitive slave who had escaped to freedom in Massachusetts. He was arrested on May 24, 1854 after he was found by his owner in Boston. According to the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, Burns had to be returned to his master Colonel Charles F. Suttle of Alexandria, VA. Boston citizens attempted to raise funds to purchase Burns' freedom and his case was brought before Loring. Despite the intense anti-slavery feeling in Massachusetts, Loring ruled that Burns would be returned to his master in the South. He believed that it was part of his duty as a U.S. Commissioner to uphold the Constitution and Congressional Law. This decision would haunt him for the rest of his career in Massachusetts.   <br>Abolitionist Wendell Phillips made the Burns case into a prominent affair and even incited a mob which marched to the courthouse where Burns was being held, killed the assistant Marshall and threatened Judge Loring's life. In addition, the Massachusetts legislature brought Loring to trial. Richard Henry Dana, Jr. the distinguished lawyer who attempted to help Burns, testified for Loring at his trial and argued that Loring had simply maintained his duties as a holder of a federal office.   <br>Conversely, Wendell Phillips testified against Loring, and relied on theories of states' rights to win his case. However, Governor Henry J. Gardner refused to execute the demand of the legislature to remove Loring from his position, a decision that cost him his reelection in 1857. Consequently, a new governor came into office in 1858. Loring lost his position when the probate judgeships were abolished and consolidated with the courts of insolvency. This consolidation of the Probate Court and the Courts of Insolvency was partly to get Loring out of office, and led to a major restructuring of the Massachusetts court system.   <br>The case of Judge Loring was the basis of the establishment of the Superior Court of Massachusetts, which was formed in 1859 to replace the Court of Common Pleas and the Superior Court of Suffolk County. The Burns decision was also instrumental in preventing Loring from obtaining a full professorship at Harvard, for the Massachusetts Senate was then a part of the Harvard Board of Overseers. Loring had been a lecturer at the Dane Law School from 1852 to 1855 as well as on the committee to revise the statutes of the law school, but the overwhelming negative reaction against his decision hindered his teaching prospects at Harvard.   <br>The difficulties Loring experienced over the Burns decision made him a hero in the South and President Buchanan decided to name him to the Court of Claims in Washington, D.C. in 1858. He served until he retired from public life in 1877.

Charles had graduated from Harvard in 1812 and had begun studying as a student at the Litchfield Law School in 1813. In 1814 they became engaged and they married four years later. During their marriage she and Charles had four children. Anna passed away in 1836. John Pierce Brace wrote of his sister 'Ann P. Brace's character was of very slow growth. When young and during my college life, she was indolent and seldom roused to mental effort. Her memory was poor, her mind slow, and her imagination feeble. When I took the school in 1814, she was then just engaged to Charles G. Loring of Boston, whom she married & was then taken under the immediate care of Aunt Mary, and resided at Miss Pierce's. Aunt Mary's judicious training out of school and the exertions of Aunt Sarah & myself in school, soon made her a good scholar, of uncommon strength of judgment and keeness of appreciation. She possessed an infinite fund of humour, was a capital comic actress, and had the keenest sense of ridiculous of anyone I ever met with, save Emma Brace. Few could have recognized in the polished, quiet, rather formal Boston lady, the fun loving girl. She married in 1818 and died in 1836.'

Lucas attended the College of St. Thomas, in Nelson County, Kentucky. In 1817 he went from that state to New Hampshire and later studied law in New York. In 1819 he returned to St. Louis and started by boat for South America, but changed his plans and tarried for a time at Arkansas Post and at Little Rock, reading law in both places and supporting himself by setting type for the <I>Arkansas Gazette </I>and in operating the ferry. He afterward rode the circuit in the practice of his profession, and his growing capacities and powers won to him public attention and led to his selection for honors both within and without the strict path of his profession.   <br>In 1820 he was appointed major of the militia by Governor James Miller and later was made judge of the probate court.  <br>On the 10th of May, 1832, James H. Lucas was married to Emilie Desriusseaux and they became parents of thirteen children.   <br>He returned to St. Louis in October, 1837 at the request of his father. In 1842, his father died leaving his large estate to his two children. Lucas assumed the management of the estate and as the years passed became recognized as one of the most prominent among the builders of the commonwealth through his organization of many progressive movements, his establishment of many large business enterprises and his capable political service.   <br>He acted as state senator from 1844 until 1847 but his ambition was never in the line of office holding. His public spirited citizenship, however, prompted him to put forth effective aid in advancing the interests of St. Louis. His realization of the value of railroad building as the most potent force in the development of a state led him to subscribe one hundred thousand dollars for the construction of the Missouri Pacific Railroad and he was twice elected its president. He assisted in organizing and acted as president of the Gas Company and was a promoter of the Boatmen's Savings Institution.   <br>After 1851 he established a banking house in St. Louis with a branch in San Francisco. In 1853 the business was reorganized, others becoming interested, but on the 21st of October, 1853, owing to the widespread financial panic, both banks failed. Although Mr. Lucas was not legally bound, he assumed the responsibility and paid the entire liabilities with ten per cent interest, at a clear loss to himself of a half million dollars.   <br>His high moral sense was one of his chief characteristics, and though he inherited and controlled an immense fortune, he was never known to take advantage of the necessities of another, and, in fact, would rather have met financial loss than to in any way compromise his commercial honor. He built the Lucas Market and gave ten thousand dollars toward the erection of the Southern Hotel. He also gave ten thousand dollars to the Missouri Historical Society and was at all times interested in movements for intellectual and moral progress. He died November 11, 1873, and his wife passed away December 24, 1878.

He was educated at Brown University before he attended the Litchfield Law School in 1822. Mann was admitted to the bar in Dedham, Massachusetts in 1823 where he began practicing law.   <br>Ten years later he began a four year term as a State Senator. As a Senator, Horace Mann became increasingly interested in social issues. He supported legislation to prohibit the sale of alcohol and lottery tickets, and to support the creation of state hospitals for the insane. Mann was instrumental in leading Massachusetts to form the first state board of education.   <br>Horace Mann’s interest in the standard of educational practices led him to give up law and his role in the Senate. He was appointed as the Secretary of the Massachusetts State Board of Education in 1837. Although the powers of the board were limited, it was able to affect public attitudes about school issues and to create public support for increasing the pay of teachers and improving their training through the founding of teacher-training schools.   <br>In 1843, Horace Mann toured Europe to study educational conditions and methods. When he returned to the United States, he championed features of European education including the abolition of corporal punishment. He was opposed by conservator educators who believed in the practice and was attacked by church officials for advocating schools not be run by religious sects. However, these attacks drew public attention to school issues. Mann’s ideas were published in 12 annual reports which have become a record of the period of major educational reform in Massachusetts and the basis for a new school system throughout the entire country.   <br>Horace Mann resigned as Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education in 1848 when he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives to fill a vacancy caused by the death of John Quincy Adams. He served until 1853, when he became president of Antioch College (now Antioch University) in Yellow Springs, Ohio. It was a newly founded, non-sectarian, co-educational college which symbolized the many reforms proposed by Mann in his earlier positions.

Because Adams had filled 58 judicial positions (42 justices of the peace and 16 federal judgeships), the Secretary of State, John Marshall, was unable to deliver all of the commissions before assuming his new role as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.  <br>The men Adams appointed became known as the 'Midnight Judges' for Adams' last-minute exploitation of the Judiciary Act of 1801 and the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801.  <br>The appointments were made during the last few days before Adams left office, and were not delivered before the new President, Thomas Jefferson, was sworn in. Jefferson reduced the number of commissions from 42 to 30, and reappointed members of his own party to five of the 30 justice of the peace positions. William Marbury was among those whose commission was destroyed.  <br>Marbury then asked the Supreme Court to issue a writ of mandamus (an order forcing a public official to take action) compelling Madison to award Marbury his commission.  <br>The Supreme Court determined that, while Marbury was legally entitled to hold the position Adams appointed him to, the Court had no authority to order the Secretary of State to deliver the paperwork because the Judiciary Act of 1789, in which Congress gave the Supreme Court original jurisdiction over such matters, was unconstitutional because it awarded the Court powers not specifically prescribed in the Constitution.

His parents were Edmunds Mason, the Clerk of the Court of Greensville, VA for twenty years, and his wife Frances Ann Young. He began his legal studies in 1816 by studying with Judge Griffin Stith of Jerusalem, VA. However, in early August of that year, Mason became very ill and took a trip to the southern part of the state. Mason later wrote that he met many lovely girls there who cured him of his afflictions. He returned to study with Judge Stith in December of 1816, but Stith died only six months later.   <br>His father wanted to send him away for further legal education, but was concerned about student 'riots' at William & Mary in February of 1817. Therefore, he went to study at the Litchfield Law School where he was one of fourty three students from fourteen states.   <br> After completing his studies he returned to VA. In 1821, he married Mary Anne Fort at 'Fortsville,' her family home which was a 2,119 acre plantation in Southampton County, VA. The couple then resided at her plantation because her mother was an invalid and Mary Anne was an only child.   <br>In 1823, Mason was assigned by Greensville County Court to represent 'Scipio,' a slave accused of breaking into a store and taking merchandise, money, and bonds. The court paid him $25 to represent Scipio and he skillfully won an acquittal in the case. Mason then began a prominent as well as varied career in both state and federal government. Mason was elected to the Virginia House of Representatives in 1823 and served one term. He later sucessfully ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1831 and held his seat until 1837. While in congress he introduced a bill recognizing the independence of Texas. He then was appointed Judge for the U.S. Eastern District of VA. Several years later he became Secretary of the Navy from 1844 to 1849.   <br>In 1849 he retired from politics and resumed his legal practice in Richmond, VA. That same year he became the President of the James River and Kanawha Canal Project. During this time, Mason also served as the Vice President of the Virginia Historical Society. He attended the Virginia Constitutional Convention in 1850 as a presiding member.   <br>Despite his apparent retirement from politics, President Franklin Pierce appointed him the U.S. Minister to France in 1853. He was reappointed to this post by President James Buchanan in 1857. Mason held his post until his death two years later in Paris, France.

He was a Continental Army officer from Connecticut during the American Revolutionary War and founder of the Morris Academy, a pioneer in coeducation.    Born in Litchfield County, Connecticut, James Morris spent his early life hoping and training to be minister. However, after graduating from Yale College, Morris accepted a commission of First Lieutenant from the Continental Army and joined the fight for American Independence. Morris was captured during the Battle of Germantown and spent most of the remaining war in captivity. Upon his release, Morris was promoted to the rank of Captain and supported Alexander Hamilton in the Siege of Yorktown. When he returned from the war, Morris began and ran an academy in the South Farms area of Litchfield which trained both boys and girls together, a rarity at the time.    By 1790, it had become common for children to come to Morris's house for instruction and access to his library. Morris welcomed all of these students, both male and female. Morris's coeducation caused some stir within the community when some claimed that his education of women was ''blowing up their pride' so that 'they would feel themselves above their mates and they would feel above labour.'' In 1794, these frustrations were brought to fruition when a hearing was held in the church. The charges were dismissed and the publicity from the controversy brought so much attention, that, by 1803, he had instructed students 'from all the New England States except Rhode Island, and from the States of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia. Also from the Island of St. Thomas in the West Indies, and from the Island of Bermuda.'    By the turn of the century, Morris found it necessary to formalize his instruction and construct a proper Academy building.[28] The estimated cost was $1200, so Morris enlisted wealthy residents of Litchfield and South Farms.    On November 28, 1803, The Morris Academy moved out of James Morris's home and into the brand new building. For the period from 1803 to 1812, the Morris Academy grew to an average of 50-75 students per year. After Morris' death in 1820, the Academy was handed to several other heads of school, until, on April 12, 1888, the Morris Academy was closed for good.    Toward the end of his life, Morris compiled his memoirs, which were subsequently published as Memoirs of James Morris of South Farms In Litchfield.  James Morris died on April 20, 1820 and was buried in the graveyard at what is now commonly referred to as the East Morris cemetery.

He later graduated from the University of Georgia in 1821. ",Georgia in 1823 ,He studied briefly with Judge Augustin S. Clayton.,,,"Eugenius Nisbet was the son of Dr. James and Penelope (Cooper) Nisbet. While at the University of Georgia, he was a member of the Demosthenian Society. Nisbet graduated from the University of Georgia with 'highest honors' and as his class valedictorian, before he was even nineteen years old. He then studied with Judge Augustin Smith Clayton of Athens, GA before traveling to Litchfield.     After his admission to the bar at age 20, he worked as a lawyer in Madison, Georgia until 1827, at which time he was elected to the state house of representatives. During that time, Nisbet married and he and his wife had twelve children. Nisbet was very politically active and successively became a member of three political parties, the State-Rights, the Whigs, and the Know-Nothings.     In 1830, Nisbet became a trustee of the University of Georgia. Two years later he acted as a member of a convention which had been appointed to consider the reduction of representatives in both branches of the Legislature. He was also offered the chair of Belles letters at both the University of Georgia and Oglethorpe College. Nisbet was one of the founders of Oglethorpe College, and when he was elected to the chair of Belles letters there in 1835 he declined the offer.     In 1836, Nisbet lost an election for the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1837, he moved his family to Macon, GA and established a law firm there. He also served as the Director of the Ocmulgee Bank. At the end of his second term in the U.S. House of Representatives, Nisbet resigned because his law firm was in debt.     As an Associate Justice of the Georgia Supreme Court, he wrote several important opinions. In <I>William Culbreath vs. James M. Culbreath & Daniel C. Culbreath,</I> he maintained that there was a distinction between ignorance of the law and a mistake in understanding it and he said that the courts had to recognize this difference. In another case <I>Wiley Mitchum vs. The State of Georgia,</I> Nisbet ruled that a new trial should be granted because a lawyer had commented on unproven facts before a jury and these comments later influenced a decision by another court.     When he resigned from the bench in 1853, Nisbet resumed his law practice in Macon, GA, briefly becoming a partner of Benjamin Harvey Hill.     Nisbet was an important member of the Georgia Know-Nothing Party and was chosen delegate for the 1861 secession convention at Milledgeville, GA. He proposed a resolution which argued for the right of Georgia to secede from the Union and to form the Southern Confederacy. Nisbet was the Chairman of the Committee which drafted the ordinance of secession. In 1861, he ran for Governor against Joseph H. Brown and lost, and also declined an election to the Confederate Congress.     Nisbet was the author of the first fourteen volumes of the Georgia Reports. He received two honorary degrees in 1868, one from his alma mater the University of Georgia and the second from Mercer University. He was a life long member of the Presbyterian Church. Nisbet continued to practice law in Macon until his death from a cold which he had contracted while laying the cornerstone of the Macon Courthouse. He was buried in Rose Hill Cemetery.","<I>Litchfield Eagle,</I> October 6, 1823  <br><I>Catalogue of the Litchfield Law School</I> (Hartford, CT: Press of Case, Tiffany and Company, 1849), 19.

For over forty years he held the office of Ruling Elder in the Presbyterian Church, and at different times, occupied almost every position to which laymen are eligible in that Church, including that of delegate to the General Assembly in 1837..  Nature had endowed him with a comprehensive, clear and discriminating mind- a fine person- a genial temper and an affectionate heart; and religion, educational training, study, reading, social and professional intercourse and travel and observation, all combined to make him one of the most interesting, attractive, valuable and exemplary men that have ever blessed the world.'

He was the eldest son of Dr. Elisha Phelps, a physician. He entered the Litchfield Law School, when he was only eighteen years of age. So assiduously did he apply himself to his studies, in order to keep pace with his fellow-students, most of whom had the advantage of age and a superior education, that his health failed. At last, being threatened with pulmonary disease, he left Litchfield for Woodbury, where he entered his name as a student with Hon. Noah B. Benedict. Here he became an inmate of the house which he occupied until his death—since known as the ' Judge Phelps Place,' but more recently as the ' Parker Academy.'  <br>In 1809 he married Elsie, youngest daughter of the Rev. John Hutgers Marshall, first Rector of St. Paul's Church, Woodbury. They had six children. He later married Amanda, daughter of Dr. Joseph Parker, of South Farms, now Morris and had two additional children.   <br>After the usual course of study, he was called to the Bar, and was a trusted and honored counsellor and advocate, to the day of his death. He was Judge of Probate for the District comprising Woodbury, Bethlehem, Southbury, and Roxbury, from 1823 to 1834; and was re-appointed in '35, '36, '37, '42, '43, and '46; and again from 1849 to 1858, when his age rendered him ineligible. During the twenty-five years that he held this most responsible office, he never had a decision reversed by the higher courts.   <br>He was a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives in 1831, '37, and '52. The latter year he was chosen Speaker. In 1843 he was a member of the Senate and President of that body. He was Postmaster of Woodbury from 1831 to 1841. In 1850 he was appointed Judge of the County Court for the County of Litchfield, and was re-appointed in 1852. He was admitted to the Bar of the Supreme Court of New York.  <br>On the 21st of Dec, 1859, he was present at a meeting of the Committee appointed by the Connecticut Legislature to superintend the erection of a monument to Col. Seth Warner, an officer of the Revolution. The Committee, (of which Judge Phelps was chairman,) met in Roxbury, at the house of Nathan Smith, Esq. Gov. Buckingham and other distinguished citizens were present. He was addressing the Committee and other gentlemen, upon the subject under discussion, when he suddenly paused, as if hesitating for a word, put his hand to his forehead, sank back into his chair, and died.

He and his wife had three sons and three daughters and their first son was named for William Alston.   <br>Pierpont then moved to Newburyport, MA where he opened a law office and also published some poetry. He later established a dry goods business in Boston, MA with his brother-in-law Joseph L. Lord. They also attempted to open a branch in Baltimore, MD, but it failed in the War of 1812. While in Baltimore, MD, he published <I>Airs of Palestine</I> in 1816 which was regarded at the time as a great literary effort.   <br>Rather than return to legal practice, Pierpont decided to become a minister. After graduation from Harvard Divinity School, he became the Pastor of Hollis Street Church in Boston, MA for the next twenty-six years. During this time, he also published two school readers, the first being <I>The American Class Book,</I> which was published in 1822 and the second, <I>The National Reader,</I> which was published in 1827. Both readers went through many editions and were the first American readers that included selections from Shakespeare.   <br>Pierpont also published the <I>Airs of Palestine and Other Poems</I> (1840) and <I>The Anti-Slavery Poems of John Pierpont </I> (1843). There were some problems with his parish regarding his abolitionist and temperence views, and in 1845 Pierpont went to Troy, NY. He worked as a minister there until 1849. Pierpont then moved again, this time to West Medford, MA, where he again acted as a minister from 1849 to 1858.   <br>During the Civil War, he acted as the Chaplain of the 22nd Massachusetts Regiment from September to November of 1861.

After attending the Litchfield Law School, he moved to Black Rock, which is now a part of Buffalo, New York, where he practiced law and conducted several businessnes, including one that was involved in building the Erie Canal.   <br>In 1802 he served as a State Representative, a position he would hold again in 1828. From 1809 until 1813, and again in 1815 and 1816 he represented the state of New York in the U.S. Congress. While in Congress, Porter made a speech in favor of national support for the construction of the Erie Canal and was appointed by the New York legislatiure in 1810 to a commission which was to study plans for a canal between the Hudson River and Lake Erie.   <br>In November 1811, as Chairman of the Congressional Committee on Foreign Relations, he prepared and introduced a Report which recomended war with Great Britain. Porter was known as a 'War Hawk' who wanted the conquest of Canada, and was also a member of Clay's committee which considered American complaints against the British and recommended the 1812 Declaration of War.   <br>During the War of 1812, he served as a Colonel in the New York State Militia. He recruited a brigade of volunteers from Pennsylvania and New York which was active on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls. When Black Rock was captured by the British and his house became a British headquarters, Porter raised troops to expel them. During July of 1813, he was appointed by Governor Tompkins as the Brigadier General of the New York Militia and advanced to the rank of Major General.   <br>At the conclusion of the war, President Madison offered him an appointment as Commander-in-Chief that Porter declined. On November 3, 1814 he received the Gold Medal from Congress for his military services. In 1815 and 1816 he served as Secretary of State, and in 1817 he ran for Governor of New York, but was defeated by DeWitt Clinton.

Raymond went on to author several legal and political works and is considered the first American born important political economist.   <br>He argued from an anti-slavery viewpoint in <I>The Missouri Question,</I> which was published in 1819. In 1820, he published <I>Thoughts on Political Economy.</I> This work established his reputation and was the first important work on this subject produced in America.   <br>He theorized that 'labor creates wealth,' which may have been an improvement based on the thinking of Adam Smith of Europe. Daniel Raymond thought that the economy of England was actually the economy of the higher-ranking members of that society, and not the economy of the entire nation. He held that wealth is not an aggregation of exchange values, as Adam Smith had conceived it. Daniel Raymond held that wealth is the capacity or opportunity to acquire the necessaries and conveniences of life by labor.  <br> Raymond defined political economy as the science of political prosperity and argued that national prosperity required a liberal measure of deliberate economic control. This theory was in direct oppositions to Adam Smith's laissez-faire policies and Raymond sought to free the national economy from foreign theories of a political economy.   <br>After those publications, Matthew Carey (who became the chief proponent of Raymond's theory) offered Johns Hopkins money for a chair in political economy if Raymond would take the position. Raymond, however, declined the offer.

Tapping Reeve, the son of a Presbyterian minister, was born in Brookhaven, Long Island, in October 1744. He entered the College of New Jersey (now Princeton) at 15 and graduated first in his class in 1763. In 1771 Reeve left his post as tutor at Princeton to read law in the traditional way in a judge's office in Hartford, Conn. In a year he was admitted to the bar, and he moved to the remote village of Litchfield, Conn., to begin his practice. As his reputation grew, young prospective lawyers began to seek Reeve out to supervise their legal preparation. But he soon went beyond the usual procedures (which gave the clerks little or no overview in their reading and only a perfunctory knowledge of established legal forms) to introduce them to the substantive principles and concepts of law. In the absence of accessible textbooks and reports, he inaugurated in 1782 a series of formal and connected lectures which embraced the whole field of jurisprudence. Two years later, with students overflowing home and office, he erected a small frame building near his home and assembled his law library there. In this school he met his classes of from 10 to 20 men. On Saturdays the students were examined on the week's lectures, and Monday evenings were reserved for moot court sessions. For 14 years Reeve conducted the school alone, but when, in 1798, he was appointed a judge of the superior court, James Gould began to share the teaching duties. The notes from their lectures, as the school catalog noted in 1828, 'constitute books of reference, the great advantage of which must be apparent to every one of the slightest acquaintance with the ... Law.' Before the school closed in 1833 because of increased competition from New York, New Haven, and Boston, Reeve and Gould graduated more than 1,000 lawyers. The roster of names reads like a 'Who's Who in Nineteenth-century America,' including 2 U.S. vice presidents, 3 Supreme Court justices, 6 Cabinet members, and 116 congressmen. After 16 years on the state supreme court Reeve was elevated in 1814 to chief justice. He retired the next year, at the age of 70. He published The Law of Baron and Femme (1816), a legal analysis of domestic relations that went into four editions. Financially straitened and flagging with age, he withdrew from his school partnership in September 1820 and died in Litchfield on Dec. 13, 1823.",,Tapping Reeve.jpg,,,,,,,Lawyer;Educator,,,Elizabeth Thompson Reeve/1799;Sally Burr Reeve/1771 June 4,,,Side Chairs - 1773;Furniture Suite;Elijah Adams letter;Elizabeth Thompson Reeve correspondence;Silver Spoon;John C.

(William Sampson consistently defended Irish rights within the United States including Catholics attacked by Orangemen in New York City, NY. In 1824, he also appeared in several cases before the Supreme Court.)   <br>John Sampson was named after John Philpot Curran, who was his godfather and an Irish patriot who had lived with his family while he was a boy. John and the rest of his family came to the United States in 1810 to join their father. While John Sampson was admitted to the bar at New York City in 1815, he was later 'driven from the bar' by the constant requirement to take oaths. In May of 1815, he made an extensive tour of the West and upon his return went to the Litchfield Law School in 1817. His cousin Charles George Spaight later attended Litchfield Law School in 1822. Sampson made a Fourth of July address in 1818 and achieved great celebrity with his speech.   <br>He eventually settled in Louisiana where he was the editor of the <I>Louisiana Advertiser</I>.

Schell became an expert in corporate law with his older brother Richard, who was a leader on Wall Street and became involved in various investments with Augustus. He was a close friend of Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt and supported him in all of his railroad developments.   <br>In 1862, Schell became the Director of the Hudson River Railroad. Five years later he served as the Director of the Lake Shore and Michigan Central Railroad. His great financial and legal acumen placed him on the board of many different railroad companies throughout his life. Schell was also an able director of several banks and insurance companies. He acted as the Vice President of the Union Trust Company and as the Chairman of the legal committee of the Union Telegraph Company.   <br>Schell also maintained a strong interest in the political workings of New York City, NY.

From 1835 to 1855 he acted as the Chairman of the State of New York's Democratic Committee. He was a supporter of James Buchanan in 1856 and was rewarded for his loyalty in 1857 with post of Collector of the Port of New York.   <br>After the Civil War, he reorganized Tammany Hall after Tweed's downfall. In 1872, he succeeded William Marcy Tweed as Grand Sachem and held this position until his death. That same year there was a second attempt to nominate him for Governor but this was prevented by the work of Samuel Jones Tilden. From 1872 to 1876, he worked as the Chairman of the National Democratic Committee and managed Horace Greeley's presidential campaign. Schell ran for both mayor and state representative but lost both races.   <br>In addition, Schell also pursued some charitable and academic interests. He was Chaiman of the Executive Committee of the New York Historical Society for nineteen years, and acted as the President twice. Schell also served as the President of the New York Institute for the Blind from 1866 until his death. During the panic of 1873, his brother Richard's firm failed but Augustus remained financially sound. He was worth several million dollars at his death but had no children and left all of his money to his nieces and nephews.

After graduating from Harvard in 1817, Schuyler attended the Litchfield Law School. Schuyler, first working as a stockbroker and private banker, developed an interest in railroads and moved into the industry, quickly establishing himself as one of its leading executives during the industry's period of tremendous growth. He held numerous positions with various railroads, including: President of the New York & New Haven Railroad from 1846 to 1854, President of the New York & Harlem Railroad from 1848 to 1853, President of the Illinois Central Railroad from 1851 to 1853, President of the Sagamore & Morgan Railroad and President of the Rensselaer & Saratoga Railroad. He also served as a Director of numerous other railroad companies.    His illustrious career came to an abrupt end in 1853 when he was the subject of a major railroad stock fraud case in which stocks were issues for nonexistent routes. His confession to the embezzlement of huge sums from the New York & New Haven Railroad Company stunned Wall Street and caused a tremendous panic in the trading of railroad stocks. Schuyler, known as 'the great American railroad defaulter' fled in disgrace to Europe, where he died in 1855. Once one of the most famous financiers on Wall Street, his disgrace led to major reorganizations within the leading railroad companies of the country.

A committed Whig, he took a deep interest in local politics, serving on the city council and as first mayor of Macon.

Scott thought so highly of Seymour that he appointed him military governor of the Castle of Perote, Santa Anna's home, and allowed him to escort the defeated general to exile in Jamaica. The only real reversals of fortune to beset Seymour came in his family life. He and his wife, Caroline E. Whitlock, (a Litchfield Female Academy graduate) whom he married in 1829, lost three children in infancy and a fourth, their daughter Caroline, at the age of 19.

Style. His early education was received at the long known and celebrated 'Hartford Grammar School,' then, no less than now, appreciated as one of the best literary institutions of the kind in New England.  <br>After leaving this school, and when quite young, he placed himself under the tuition of the eccentric and celebrated Dr. Seth Bird of Litchfield, one of the most prominent medical men of his time in the State, who was his relative by marriage, and a most suitable instructor for a young man of Sheldon's age and abilities. He continued with Dr. Bird some years. When at the early age of twenty-one he commenced the practice of medicine in that part of Woodbury, Conn., now incorporated into a separate town by the name of Washington. His practice soon became so extensive that he took as a partner in business Dr. Seth Hastings, father of the celebrated musician of that name, a gentleman who afterwards gained great celebrity in his profession.  <br>While Dr. Sheldon remained in Woodbury he married Miss Charlotte Judson [?-1784, married in 1777], by whom he had two children, one a daughter [Charlotte Sheldon, 1780?-1840?] who was insane for a long period, and died at the Retreat in Hartford. The other, Daniel Sheldon, Esq., [1780?-1828] who was for many years Clerk in the Treasury Department at Washington with Secretaries Wolcott and Gallatin, and afterwards went to France with Mr. Gallatin as Secretary of Legation and charge of affairs. When Dr. Lemuel Hopkins left Litchfield for the city of Hartford in 1784, Dr. Sheldon removed to Litchfield, and continued there till his death. [Other sources indicate Dr. Sheldon moved to Litchfield in 1781 followng the birth of his son in 1780.] In this new location his practice became more respectable and extensive, and he established a reputation which was not surpassed by any medical practitioner, in the State. Dr. Sheldon married for his second wife Miss Huldah Stone [1759-1817, marrried in 1784], sister of Mrs. Hopkins. From this time a friendship commenced between these two eminent medical men which continued till the death of Dr. Hopkins in 1800. [Dr. Sheldon and Huldah Stone Sheldon had four children: Lucy Sheldon Beach (1788-1889), Frederick Sheldon (1785-1859), Henry Sheldon (1790-1868?), and William Sheldon (1802-1826).]  <br>Dr. Sheldon was a great supporter of the LItchfield Female Academy. The Sheldon house located on North Street, just to the north of the Female Academy housed borders during the school's operation.   <br>In person Dr. Sheldon was small, slender and delicate. He was predisposed by the conformation of his chest to pulmonary complaints, and while young had an abscess formed in his lungs, which burst and discharged an immense quantity of pus so fetid that for months after it was disagreeable to be in the room with him, or even to ride by his side on the highway. Dr. Sheldon gave the writer a particular account of the illness which preceded this great abscess. He was sick two weeks with what was considered a mild remittent fever, in which he had chills, exacerbations of heat, and finally free sweating. He was attended by Dr. Bird and Hopkins, who were esteemed the best physicians in the State, and who were not inferior to any others. On the fourteenth day of the fever, Dr. Bird visited his patient, and found him in a free perspiration, and encouraged him that as the time for a crisis had arrived, and the perspiration indicated its commencement, he might expect that the disease would soon yield and he would be again convalescent. Before Dr. Bird left the room the abscess burst, and established beyond controversy the true nature of the disease. This ulcer did not wholly heal for two years. During its discharge he took an immense quantity of Peruvian bark in infusion or decoction, and contracted a habit of taking opium, which continued till old age, when it was abandoned. Dr. Sheldon informed the writer that such was the quantity of bark taken in the course of his illness that the grounds rejected amounted to more than two bushels. He took from two to four drachms of opium daily for nearly or quite forty years. In old age he left it off without detriment gradually diminishing it for two or three years. His usual pill was a drachm which he swallowed without difficulty.  <br>In a very short time after the discharge of this abscess of the lungs, Dr. Sheldon resumed his practice which had been interrupted for a few weeks only, and rode on a bleak and rough country more than half a century, always on horseback, performing an immense amount of business, while his emaciated and extremely delicate frame, drawn over almost to a curve, would indicate such a feeble state as entirely to forbid any active employment. Dr. Sheldon lived to the extreme age of 89 years and a half, and towards the close of life became corpulent and bulky. He died April 10th, 1840.  <br>Dr. Sheldon was endowed by nature with a vigorous and well balanced mind; he was quick to discover and ready to apply all his knowledge in the practice of his profession. He had the tact which led him at once to the indication of disease, and boldness in his prescriptions which only comes properly from a thorough knowledge of the case. He was also a learned man, fond of books, and a thorough, diligent student. He had a faculty of gleaning from authors whatever was valuable in their works by a hasty perusal of their pages. His memory was retentive, he profited greatly by his own experience, and was enabled to have analogies by which that experience was of great value to him. In the treatment of pulmonary consumption he had great and desired celebrity. Many persons affected with symptoms of that disease, flocked to him from a great distance, and his success sustained his reputation, till from age and infirmity he ceased to practice his profession. The writer met him repeatedly in such cases. There was no quackery about his practice, but plain, open, common sense views of what changes might be wrought by perseverance and suitable remedies.  <br>Accustomed as he was to the use of opium in his own case, he was not afraid to prescribe it for others. His remedies were simple, but effective. Substantial diet, narcotic and tonic remedies, and riding on horseback, which he considered superior to all other means of restoration, and quite superior to all other modes of exercise. He was a successful physician in this and other chronic cases, and his counsel was sought by many respectable individuals near and remote. It was my good fortune to meet him occasionally, and at our last interview he spent some days with me at my residence. His conversation was most instructive and his kindness and courtesy made a deep impression on my feelings. In investigating a case of pulmonary consumption, he paid great attention to the nature of the secretions from the lungs. If the pus was benign, he gave, in many cases, a favorable prognosis, and many cases with symptoms very alarming, recovered under his prescriptions, in which other physicians predicted unfavorably. In a case under my care in which low diet, and antiphlogistics had been prescribed by a physician high in the confidence of the patient, he recommended animal food, and a generous diet of vegetables and fruits, myrrh, iron and opium. The patient gained strength, flesh and courage under this treatment, but finally fell a victim to the disease.  <br>The evening of Dr. Sheldon's days were spent in tranquillity and ease. To a competency saved from the earnings of his professional life, a good fortune was added by a legacy from a son, who died in France some years before his father.  <br>Dr. Sheldon was an ardent friend of medical improvement, He was one of the original petitioners for the establishment of a State Medical Society, and for many years was an active member of the Society, and its Secretary.The honorary degree of Doctor of Medicine was conferred upon him by the corporation of Yale College.  <br>  <br> The above information was taken from: Williams, Stephen West.<I> American Medical Biography: or, Memoirs of Eminent Physicians.</I> Greenfield, MA: L.

2307,Roger Sherman,,,M,,Newtown,MA,United States,"April 19, 1721","July 23, 1793",,,,,,"In 1723, when Sherman was 2 years of age, his family relocated from his Newton, Massachusetts, birthplace to Dorchester (present Stoughton). As a boy, he was spurred by a desire to learn and read widely in his spare time to supplement his minimal education at a common school. But he spent most of his waking hours helping his father with farming chores and learning the cobbler's trade from him. In 1743, 2 years after his father's death, Sherman joined an elder brother who had settled in New Milford, Connecticut.   <br>Purchasing a store, becoming a county surveyor, and winning a variety of town offices, Sherman prospered and assumed leadership in the community. In 1749, he married Elizabeth Hartwell, by whom he had seven children. Without benefit of a formal legal education, he was admitted to the bar in 1754 and embarked upon a distinguished judicial and political career. In the period 1755-61, except for a brief interval, he served as a representative in the colonial legislature and held the offices of justice of the peace and county judge. Somehow he also eked out time to publish an essay on monetary theory and a series of almanacs incorporating his own astronomical observations and verse.   <br>In 1761, Sherman abandoned his law practice, and moved to New Haven, Connecticut. There, he managed two stores, one that catered to Yale students, and another in nearby Wallingford. He also became a friend and benefactor of Yale College, and served for many years as its treasurer. In 1763, or three years after the death of his first wife, he wed Rebecca Prescott, who bore eight children.   <br>Meanwhile, Sherman's political career had blossomed. He rose from justice of the peace and county judge to an associate judge of the Connecticut Superior Court and to representative in both houses of the colonial assembly. Although opposed to extremism, he promptly joined the fight against Britain. He supported nonimportation measures and headed the New Haven committee of correspondence.   <br>Sherman was a longtime and influential member of the Continental Congress (1774-81 and 1783-84). He won membership on the committees that drafted the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation, as well as those concerned with Indian affairs, national finances, and military matters. To solve economic problems, at both national and state levels, he advocated high taxes rather than excessive borrowing or the issuance of paper currency.   <br>While in Congress, Sherman remained active in state and local politics, continuing to hold the office of judge of the Connecticut Superior Court, as well as membership on the council of safety (1777-79). In 1783 he helped codify Connecticut's statutory laws. The next year, he was elected mayor of New Haven (1784-86).   <br>Although on the edge of insolvency, mainly because of wartime losses, Sherman could not resist the lure of national service. In 1787, he represented his state at the Constitutional Convention, and attended practically every session. Not only did he sit on the Committee on Postponed Matters, but he also probably helped draft the New Jersey Plan and was a prime mover behind the Connecticut, or Great, Compromise, which broke the deadlock between the large and small states over representation. He was, in addition, instrumental in Connecticut's ratification of the Constitution.   <br>Sherman concluded his career by serving in the U.S. House of Representatives (1789-91) and Senate (1791-93), where he espoused the Federalist cause. He died at New Haven in 1793 at the age of 72 and is buried in the Grove Street Cemetery.

He also acted as a Major General in the Artillery. After his marriage, he built an elegant house in Whitesborough, NY.   <br>In addition to his legal practice and political career, Sill invested in several woolen mills on the Mohawk River including the Oriskany Woolen Mill which imported a large number of merino sheep from Spain for their superior wool.

2317,Moses Aaron Simons,,,M,,London,,England,,1822,Graduated from Yale College in 1809.,,,,,"Moses Aaron Simons, perhaps America’s first black lawyer, was the son and namesake of Moses Simons, a Jewish immigrant who moved from London to South Carolina between the years of 1772-1783. In South Carolina, Moses’ extended family owned considerable property, including slaves. No mention is ever made of Moses’ mother, but as an object of note the five Simons sons were known for black and Mulatto mistresses, of which reference is made to in their wills. Moses is believed to be a child of such a union. Until recently, his race was unrecognized.     Between 1805 and 1809, Moses attended Yale University as its first Jewish student, earning a BA. He then attended Litchfield Law School in 1810 and was admitted to the NY Bar in 1816. From 1816 until 1820, Moses served in the NYC Criminal Court. He was recognized by friends and colleagues as a man of good character, education, and respectability with a promising career ahead of him.     In December 1817, at a public dance Moses and his brother were asked to leave by the host, dancing master Charles Berault, after the man received a series of complaints and threats from other attendees about the presence of the colored men. At the next dance, an altercation with Berault in which Moses felt he was wrongly treated led to him slapping the host and being arrested under warrant.     In the resulting 1818 case, People vs. Moses Simons, Moses was well defended by colleagues and wealthy connections but was found guilty of the assault and assessed a small fee. Commentary of the case published by court reporter Daniel Rogers undermined Simon’s professional standing amongst members of the bar in racial terms. Although Simons continued to practice for the next two years, his career slowly dwindled after the trial. In 1821, he moved to London where he is believed to have died in 1822.

His industry, his fidelity to professional trusts, his learning and his marvellous power before juries, gave a leadership at the circuits which he never lost. The jury trial was the favorite theatre of his professional contests, and it was as the advocate that he was without a peer. The methods of conducting litigation in his time differed from the present. Then the great object was to secure a verdict from the twelve men. On their decision hung the issues of life and death and fortune. This made the counsel who could carry the jury, whether by magic or storm, an indispensable ally. Appeals were comparatively few. Now-a-days when the jury in Bo many trials is but an incident, and law, as has been said with much humor and some wisdom, is the power of decision of the last judge that can hear the case, the eloquent advocate holds a position less relatively important in the trial of causes. But Judge Skinner was learned as a lawyer, as well as eloquent as an advocate, and it was this rare combination that gave him a position so distinguished before the courts.</I>  <br>Ex-President Fillmore, who presided at a meeting of the Bar of Erie County, convened to give some expression of its sentiment on the occasion of his death, in 1871, said: —  <br><I>My acquaintance with Mr. Skinner commenced in 1829, when he and I were both members of the Assembly. That was my first year, but I think it was his third year, and he had then an enviable reputation for so young a man in that distinguished body, as yet free from the suspicion of bribery, and adorned by the talents of such men as John C. Spencer, Erastus Root, Benj. F. Butler, Frank Granger, and of others. The revision of our statutes, the great work which did so much to methodize and relieve them from the cumbrous language and accumulated contradictions and inconsistencies of years, was then just completed, and in that great work Judge Skinner bore a conspicuous part. I know he was listened to with confidence and respect, and no member of the House seemed to exert a more salutary influence. My subsequent acquaintance with him was mainly at the Bar. Here he was distinguished for his legal arguments and forensic eloquence. I have often felt a tremor of anxiety when I have had to meet him. He was a man religiously devoted to the interest of his client without ever compromising his own conscience or dignity. He prepared his case with great labor and assiduity, and whatever could be said in favor of his client's interest he presented with great clearness and force, and when that was done he conceived that he had discharged his professional duty, and he patiently waited the result. The highest encominm that can ever be passed upon a man of his profession may with great propriety be passed upon him, and that is, he was a learned, conscientious lawyer. </I>  <br>Hon. James R. Doolittle, late United States senator from Wisconsin, had this to say, two years after Judge Skinner's death : —  <I>The late John B. Skinner, as a lawyer and advocate, had few equals, and no superior, for many years, in western New York. To uniform courtesy, untiring industry, unflinching and incorruptible fidelity to his clients, you must add great tact and knowledge of human nature, as well as great legal learning, and oftentimes the highest order of eloquence, to make a just estimate of his character. It was before a jury that he was, in some respects, unequalled. His efforts there were entirely extemporaneous. Those who have had great opportunity to hear the most eloquent of American orators, say there were occasions when those extemporaneous efforts of Mr. Skinner, in true eloquence and power, surpassed all his contemporaries. When fully roused, his language was pure English, — chaste, elegant, and concise. He spoke without apparent effort, with a directness, earnestness, and naturalness that seemed almost inspired. His mind, like his person, was high-wrought and of the finest mould. All his appeals and all his conversations were addressed to the better part of our nature. With truth it may be said, no one ever heard him at the Bar, or held private conversation with him, who did not feel his nobler sentiments strengthened and elevated by his influence. </I>  <br>Judge Martin Grover, of the Court of Appeals of the state of New York, who knew him very thoroughly on the circuit, and otherwise, from 1836 onwards for twenty years, embodied his recollections, in 1873, in a paper prepared for the Buffalo Historical Society. We quote: —  <br><I>Mr. Skinner attended all the circuits in Livingston, Allegheny, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, and Genesee counties, and his presence was regarded almost as essential as that of the Judge. There were then no railroads in any part of the district, and Mr. Skinner travelled from one country town to another, in company with the Judge, each with his own horse and sulky. Extensive study and large experience had made Mr. Skinner perfectly familiar with, and master of, nearly every legal question presented, and he was, therefore, able to take a leading part in nearly every case tried. His clear intellect and capacity for quick comprehension enabled him to try a cause with great ability, without any previous preparation, and with but little consultation with his client and the oiher counsel. He would grasp the entire case at once and adopt the correct mode of conducting the trial. He was very sagacious in the examination of .witnesses. An adverse witness rarely succeeded in baffling him, and, as a general rule, he would derive an advantage for his client from the reluctance of such a witness to disclose the whole truth. But his great power was in summing up to the jury. In this I have never seen one superior and scarcely ever his equal. His clear statements and close logical arguments usually convinced the understanding of his hearers, and when to these were added his powers of persuasion, the effect was overwhelming. He possessed in an eminent degree the highest powers of an orator. In listening to him no one could doubt his entire sincerity, and when he appealed to the highest and noblest principles of humanity it was the outpouring from the heart. His words went directly to the hearts of the audience. His control of their emotions was, for the time, complete. Nothing seemed to give him greater pleasure than the exertion of these high powers in the cause of justice. He was a gentleman of the old school, and exhibited these traits in all his conduct during a trial. Always courteous to the Bench, though firm and earnest in insisting upon the rights of his client, his uniform politeness to the adverse party — counsel and witnesses — had a strong tendency to restrain undue exhibitions of passion, too frequently witnessed upon exciting trials. </I>  <br>His early friend and fellow-student, Governor Marcy, appointed Skinner, in 1838, to the office of judge of the eighth circuit, who, at that time, had equity jurisdiction as vice-chancellor; but he declined the appointment. President Pierce nominated him for United States District Attorney for the northern district of New York; a position which he also declined. In the mean time, in 1846, the governor of New York appointed him Judge of the county court of Wyoming, under the new constitution of that state, a place which he held but for a few months, until the election which he lost.    <br>No other native of Williamstown certainly, perhaps it may be said no other graduate of Williams College, ever gained the breadth and constancy and solidity of reputation, at once as a lawyer and as an orator, and as a genial friend and gentleman, and as a high officer and representative of a great national church, that was acquired by John B. Skinner (Williams College, 1818), 1799-1871, the most honored among the many honored descendants of Colonel Benjamin Simonds. Let us listen for a moment to what a clergyman, Rev. J. E. Nassau, who knew him thoroughly, said of him two years after his death: <i> He was a person of the finest sensibilities, that manifested themselves continually in his domestic, Christian, and professional life and intercourse. I have often seen him profoundly affected and moved even to tears in religious meetings and public addresses, and even in common conversation upon topics that greatly interested him. And nothing took deeper hold of his emotion than the grand elemental truths of the Bible, the permanent interests of the Church, the sorrows and joys of friends, or the vital interests of the Country.</I>  <br>After his removal to Buffalo in 1800, — except an interval of eighteen months of foreign travel, in the course of which he lost, by death in Switzerland, his only child and his only grandchild, — Judge Skinner passed the last ten years of his life in the varied duties of a useful and honored citizenship. His last years, with the exception of the great sorrow just referred to, were serene and happy.  He died in Buffalo,NY in 1871.     <br> The above information was taken from <I>Origins in Williamstown </I>By Arthur Latham Perry, New York City: Charles Scribner & Sons, 1894.

His father was a member of the Connecticut Society of the Cincinnati as well as a successful merchant in Plymouth, CT. Junius was the third of four siblings to attend Yale and his brother Aaron also attended the Litchfield Law School. Junius Smith and Aaron Burr Reeve (Tapping Reeve's son) were members of the Yale Class of 1802.     After leaving Litchfield, Smith opened a law office in New Haven in 1804. A year later he was appointed to prosecute a claim against the British government for the capture of an American merchant ship. He pleaded the cause in the admiralty court in London and succeeded in obtaining large damages. Shortly afterwards, he and his brother Aaron both gave up the law to go into the mercantile business with their father and other brothers.     The Smith brothers established a successful mercantile business in New York and Junius was sent to London, England where he remained to represent the company for the next thirty-eight years. Smith also dealt in exporting British goods from the manufacturing districts of Manchester, Leeds, and Sheffield England, to the American market.     In 1832, it took a packet some fifty-four days to cross the Atlantic. Frustrated by this slow travel, Smith obtained British investors and launched the British and American Steam Navigation Company in 1836. This was the first successful attempt to provide trans-Atlantic steamers. In 1839, the company launched the <I>President</I>, the largest ship ever built, which disappeared without a trace. That same year they lost the British mail subsidy to the Cunard Line.     In 1843, Smith closed the company and returned to the United States. He established a plantation in Greenville, SC called Golden Grove and made an unsuccessful attempt to establish American tea growing.

He graduated from Princeton College in 1824 and then attended the Law School. He was admitted to the bar of Berks County, Pennsylvania, at Reading on January 10, 1827. Afterwards was engaged in the iron business with his brother-in-law, Judge William Darling, Darling and Smith were well known manufacturers of stoves. He also was an organizer of First National Bank of Reading, and its first president until his death in 1876.   <br> In <I>The History of Berks County Pennsylvania </I> the author Morton Luther Montgomery authored a detailed biography of Smith. He wrote:  <br><I>An Abolitionist in principal and an old-time Whig in his political faith, he became from the foundation of the Republican party one of its most zealous supporters. Whilst never seeking public office he was named as the Republican candidate for Congress in the Berks district in 1860, and his popularity was shown in the result at the election, when he ran considerably ahead of the State ticket. In the townships of the southern section of the county adjacent to his home his vote was especially strong. Having been placed the same year upon the Lincoln electoral ticket, he withdrew on the ground of the incompatibility of that position with his Congressional candidacy. At an earlier period he was upon several occasions a delegate to county and State conventions of the Whig and Republican parties. His judgment upon questions of finance was eminently conservative and sound, and the same shrewdness and forecast which he evinced in the management of his own large estate well qualified him for the successful discharge of the various business relations which he assumed toward others during his residence in Reading in the latter part of his life. Among these were his membership of the board of managers of the Reading Gas Company and of the Reading Fire Insurance Company, of the latter of which he was one of the organizers. Every associated effort for the literary culture and social betterment of the community received his co-operation and support.   <br>In his denominational affiliations Mr. Smith was a member of the Protestant Episcopal Church. He was a member of the vestry of St. Thomas Church, Morgantown, and a delegate for more than thirty years from that parish to the diocesan convention. In 1858 he was a delegate to the general convention which met in New York City. Upon his removal to Reading he became a vestryman of Christ Church, remaining such until his death.   <br>Personally Mr. Smith was of a genial and companionable disposition, possessing a marked and never-failing trait of humor, which made his presence at all times enlivening and agreeable. To be just to all men and faithful to his own was the ruling principle of his character and life. After a brief illness the end came to him at his home Aug. 8, 1876, when a few months advanced in the seventy-first year of his age. His estimable wife died Dec. 16, 1882. They had ten children. </I>  <br> Montgomery continued:    <br><i>He was an outspoken and fearless Abolitionist, a warm friend of the colored people and sympathizer in their troubles.</I>   <br>Smith owned Joanna Furnace in Berks County and Smith was known to help runaway slaves travel through this area of Pennsylvania by sending them to the most remote areas of the woods surrounding the Furnace and staying with them until danger passed.

His first attempts to enter the Litchfield Law School were dissuaded by Judge Reeve, due to Smith's lack of an education.

Born November 27, 1791, Truman was raised on his father's farm in Roxbury, Connecticut and completed his preparation for college under the Rev. Daniel Parker. In 1815 he grated from Yale College, and in 1817 entered into the Litchfield Law School to undertake legal studies. Upon his admission to the bar in 1818, he opened a law office in Litchfield which lasted until 1854. His first wife, Maria Cook was the daughter of Roger Cook of Litchfield, Connecticut. After she passed away, Smith married Mary Ann Dickinson, the adopted daughter of miniature painter Anson Dickinson. He had nine children between his two marriages.   <br>After serving in the Connecticut State Legislature in 1831-1832 and 1834 Truman Smith was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a member of the Whig Party in 1838. From 1838 until 1843 he served in his role as U.S. Representative, and from 1845 to 1849 served in that role again. In 1844 he was a presidential elector on the Whig ticket. In the House of Representatives Smith was mainly interested in parliamentary management on behalf of the Whig Party. He was also one of the first of the party leaders to promote the presidential candidacy of Zachary Taylor in 1848, and, as the first chairman of the Whig national committee, he directed Taylor's campaign. He declined to accept the reward of appointment as secretary of the interior however, preferring to take the seat in the Senate to which he had been elected in 1849, where he remained until his resignation from the United States Senate on May 24, 1854. During 1853, Senator Smith served on several standing committees, including Indian Affairs; Patents and the Patent Office; Post Office and Post Roads; Roads and Canals; and Printing.  <br>While serving as Senator, Smith was very active in representing his Connecticut constituents regarding international controversies, postage rates, and ports. Truman Smith's service as Senator occurred at a crucial time just before the start of the Civil War and during the discussions of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which he ardently opposed. In May of 1854, Smith resigned from the U. S. Senate soon after the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act.   <br>Following his resignation he returned to Connecticut and moved his law office from Litchfield to Stamford, and also opened a law office in New York City. In July 1862 President Abraham Lincoln appointed Truman Smith a judge of the mixed court set up by the treaty with England of April 7, 1862, for the trial of British and American vessels suspected of engaging in the slave trade. He served until the court was terminated in 1870. Smith retired from active legal practice in 1872, but remained active in several benevolent and philanthropic movements.

His mother was the daughter of Arthur Dobbs, governor of the colony in 1753-'65.   <br>Spaight lost his parents at eight years of age and received his education abroad, being graduated at the University of Glasgow. He returned home in 1778, and at twenty years of age became aide-de-camp to General Richard Caswell, and was present at the Battle of Camden during the Revolutionary War. His kinsman, Captain William Spaight, of the 65th regiment, had already been engaged at the battle of Bunker Hill on the British side.   <br>In 1781 he was elected to the North Carolina legislature, and again in 1782 and 1783. In the last year he became a member of Congress and was placed on the committee to devise a plan for the temporary government of the western territory. He was a delegate to the convention to frame the Constitution of the United States in 1787, and was active in the proceedings.   <br>In the Hillsboro', North Carolina, convention in July, 1788, though afterward a Jeffersonian Republican, he earnestly advocated the adoption of the United States constitution, but in vain. He had been in correspondence with General Washington on the subject, and the following interesting paragraph occurs in an unpublished letter to Governor Spaight, dated Mt. Vernon, May 25, 1788: 'I am sorry to find by your letter that the state of North Carolina is so much opposed to the proposed government. If a better could be agreed on, it might be well to reject this: but without such a prospect (and I confess none appears to me), policy I think must recommend the one that is submitted.' On the invitation of Governor Spaight, Washington visited North Carolina, and, in consequence of their united counsels, North Carolina ratified the constitution on November 21, 1789.   <br>Owing to feeble health Governor Spaight retired during four years from public life. In 1792 he was elected to the legislature, and he was immediately chosen governor by that body, being the first native of the state that was chief magistrate.

Born December 6, 1795, Stiles graduated from Yale College in 1814, and later that year joined the army during the last year of the War of 1812. He served as a private in the First Georgia Militia until discharge din 1815. After the war ended, Stiles resumes his education by beginning a course of study at the Litchfield Law School.   <br>He began his legal practice in Savannah with William W. Gordon. Stiles first wife died just one year after their marriage at the age of nineteen and this event led him to a religious conversion. Stiles consequently abandoned the practice of the law and began to preach, often to the slaves on his father's plantation.   <br>After his graduation from the Andover Theological Seminary, he returned to Georgia as a result of his failing eyesight and became an ordained evangelist of the Hopewell presbytery. After his second marriage in 1828, Stiles and his second wife had four daughters and three sons. Stiles moved his family frequently to preach at various locations.   <br>He first moved to Darien, GA in 1829 and the following year returned to Savannah, GA where he became the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church. In 1835, he moved with his family to central, Kentucky. However, in 1844, he moved to Richmond, VA where he preached at the Grace Street Presbyterian Church. Two years later he received an honorary degree from Transylvania College. In 1860 Stiles received an L.L.D. from the University of Georgia.  <br>In 1848, he moved to New York City and worked at the Mercer Street Church. In 1850, he became the General Agent of the American Bible Society in the South. He then relocated his family to New Haven, CT where Gerard Hallock had built a Church especially for him. His work as a General Agent for the Southern Aid Society in 1853 caused him to work for the aid of the poor southern churches and he remained sympathetic to their plight, In 1857, however, the American Home Missionary Society withdrew aid to southern churches over the issue of slavery.   <br>Stiles left his wife and four daughters in New Haven, CT and returned to the South at the beginning of the Civil War. He worked as an Evangelist Chaplain to the Confederated Troops with Stonewall Jackson from 1861 to 1862. After the war ended, he traveled as an evangelist throughout the South.

Frederick graduated from Yale College in 1811 and attended the Litchfield Law School that same year.     He was admitted to the bar in 1811, and began a law practice in New York City in 1813. During the War of 1812, he has a successful military career serving as the Captain of the Cavalry Company of New York. After the War he returned to New York and embarked on a successful political career.     He became a member of the Board of Aldermen of New York City in 1834 and served as common councilman in 1836. Tallmadge became a member of the New York State Senate from 1837 to 1840 and served as Recorder of the city of New York from 1841 to 1846.

Afterwards he became General Superintendent of the Metropolitan Police from 1857 to 1862 and clerk of the New York Court of Appeals from 1862 to 1865.    In 1858, shortly after his appointment as the General Superintendent of the Metropolitan Police, Tallmadge was placed on trial, charged with 'absolute disobedience.' At the beginning of September of 1858, long seated resentment towards the presence of a quarantine hospital on Staten Island reached a violent head. Tallmadge was reluctant to send his healthy policemen into the disease ridden area, in spite of promises of assistance made by the Mayor. Despite this episode, Tallmadge remained in office until 1862.    When he left the Court of Appeals, Tallmadge resumed the practice of law in New York City. Due to his failing health, in 1869 he returned to Litchfield, where he died on September 17, 1869.

In 1806, the Ohio legislature approved his appointment as one of the judges on the Ohio Supreme Court.   <br>In 1806, Calvin Pease, a judge of the Court of Common Pleas for the Third Circuit, declared a section of an Ohio law in violation of the Ohio Constitution of 1803. The Ohio law permitted justices of the peace to oversee legal disputes involving property or money in excess of twenty dollars. Pease declared that the Constitution promised trial by jury and that the Ohio law was a clear violation of that guarantee. As a result of Pease's decision, the law could not be enforced in Ohio. Supreme Court Justices Samuel Huntington and Tod sustained Pease's decision in the case Rutherford v. M'Faddon in 1807. The judges' actions essentially established judicial review of legislative decisions.  <br>At the heart of this case was the question of the courts' ability to declare laws unconstitutional. The legislature had no desire to relinquish any power to the judiciary. To weaken the judicial branch, the legislature attempted to impeach both Tod and Pease. The legislature acquitted both men of all crimes by a single vote. Tod resigned his seat in 1810.   <br>Following his time on the Ohio Supreme Court, Tod fought in the War of 1812, serving the American cause bravely at Fort Meigs. Upon the war's conclusion, Tod returned to the judiciary, this time as a member of the Court of Common Pleas for the Third Circuit. He held his seat from 1815 until 1829.

Whittlesey's former classmate James Simon Taylor committed suicide in 1820, reportedly after being rejected romantically by Litchfield Female Academy student Lucretia Swift, and the death was discussed in letters:     George Younglove Cutler noted in his 'Journal' for 18 October 1820 that he had received a letter from Thomas Tucker Whittlesey (Yale 1817, LLS 1818) which stated, 'Taylor has been refused by Miss Swift of Windham.'

Afterwards he was appointed a Judge of Probate, a position he held until he retired from public life.  <br>In June of 1805, Oliver Wolcott, Benjamin Tallmadge, and Frederick Wolcott signed an agreement to finance four successive voyages to China, beginning in the spring of 1806. Shares in the venture were later purchased by local merchant Julius Deming. Oliver Wolcott procured the Trident, a nearly new vessel, to carry out the trade. Goods they imported were also sold in Litchfield, as well as by Belden, Dwight, & Company of New Haven. The Embargo Act of 1807, which remained in effect until 1809, raised concerns about foreign trade which pervaded the endeavor. In April of 1809, Oliver Wolcott announced to his brother, “…we have concluded to send out the Trident with a moderate Investment & to close the existing concern with the depending voyage.”   <br>Frederick did a lot of his business with his brother, Oliver Jr. They owned the Wolcottville Manufacturing Company which manufactured woolen cloth, and they imported sheep and cattle.   <br>Throughout his life he held several other positions: he represented Litchfield in the Connecticut General Assembly, was president of the Litchfield County Foreign Mission and Education Societies, was president of the Board of Trustees of the Litchfield Female Academy, was a fellow of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, and was a fellow of Yale College.  <br>Wolcott married twice. He and his first wife had four daughters and two sons. Two of those daughters married Litchfield Law School graduates. Wolcott and his second wife had two daughters. He died in Litchfield, CT at the age of sixty-nine.","Litchfield County Bar Association Records, 1800, Litchfield Historical Society, Helga J. Ingraham Memorial Library.

2840,Oliver Wolcott,Oliver Wolcott (1726-1797),,M,,,,,"November 20, 1726","December 1, 1797",,,,,,"Oliver Wolcott was born on November 20, 1726, the youngest child in a prominent Connecticut family. His father, Roger Wolcott, was one of the first governors of the colony of Connecticut. His mother was Sarah Drake. He had three brothers who survived childhood (Alexander, Josiah, and Erastus) and four sisters (Sarah, Hephzibah, Ursula, and Mariann). They lived in Windsor, Connecticut, where both of Oliver's parents grew up.    Wolcott graduated from Yale in 1747. Afterwards, he was a captain in the army and studied medicine with his brother Alexander. In 1751, he found his way to Litchfield once it was appointed as the county seat for Litchfield County. He was elected as the first Sheriff of Litchfield that same year. He was a representative of Litchfield in the General Assembly and was a member of the militia. In July of 1775, he served as a Commissioner of Indian Affairs for the Northern Department.     In the years leading up to the Revolutionary War, Wolcott served as a representative to the Continental Congress for the state of Connecticut. In that capacity, he became one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence (Oliver Wolcott's signature appears in the right-most column, second from the bottom).    During the fighting of the Revolution, Oliver commanded fourteen regiments and was made a Brigadier General in early 1777. From February to July of 1778, he attended the Congress at Yorktown.    His home was also busy during the Revolution. Not only did George Washington stay there, but it was the focal point in Wolcott's scheme to create bullets for the Continental Army. In July 1776, a lead statue of King George III astride a horse in central Manhattan was torn down and cut into pieces. Wolcott then had these pieces brought to his home in Litchfield where it they were melted down and made into bullet cartridges.    In 1786, Oliver was elected Lieutenant-Governor of Connecticut. It was a post he held for ten years. He was a signer of the Articles of Confederation. In 1787, he was a member of the Connecticut State Convention, which voted for the ratification of the Constitution of the United States. In 1796 he was a presidential elector (he voted for John Adams, who was elected President). That same year, the town of Wolcott, Connecticut was named after the Lieutenant-Governor when he cast the deciding vote in the state legislature to incorporate the town.    Oliver then became the Governor of Connecticut after Governor Samuel Huntington died in office in early 1796. Oliver was reelected Governor, but he died in office on December 1, 1797. He is buried in the East Cemetery in Litchfield (less than a mile down the road from the Historical Society).    Wolcott married Laura Collins of Guilford, Connecticut. The couple had two sons and two daughters. Both daughters married prominent men (William Moseley, a lawyer and member of the Connecticut legislature and Chauncey Goodrich, Congressman, Senator, and state Lieutenant-Governor). His sons were Oliver Jr. and Frederick.    Wolcott was also somewhat responsible for shaping the aesthetic of the town of Litchfield. Under his direction, 13 large sycamore trees were planted North and South Streets in honor of the original colonies (although only one remains today: it is the Connecticut tree, located on South Street by St. Anthony's Church). A grander contribution, though, came in the design and construction of his house in 1752. At the time of its construction, it was the foremost domestic building in the town, reflecting the status and wealth of the family. The Georgian styling on the house was new and fashionable, although the house retained classic Connecticut design elements with its central chimney and gable-end overhangs. This combination of the two styles would remain pervasive in Connecticut through the Revolution and was a reflection of the unique area aesthetic.",,Oliver Wolcott eng.jpg,"Carley, Rachel. <i>Litchfield: The Making of a New England Town.</i> Connecticut: GHP, 2011.",,,,,,Political Office,,,"Laura Collins Wolcott/January 21, 1755",,,"Lyman Beecher Papers;Wolcott Family Collection;Oliver Wolcott Engraving;Oliver Wolcott, Jr. Papers",

Laura was the daughter of Capt. Daniel Collins of Guilford and, like Oliver, was a descendant from an early settler of New England. She was also distantly related to Timothy Collins, the first minister of Litchfield.     They had five children. Their first child, Oliver, died young. Oliver Jr. was born on January 11, 1760, followed by their daughter Laura, who was born on December 15, 1761. Mariann was born on February 16, 1765, and Frederick on November 2, 1761.When Oliver was away during the Revolutionary War, she educated their children, managed domestic family matters as well as a small farm the family owned. Also during the war, she furnished blankets, stockings, and supplies from their farm for the army.    Their daughter Laura married William Moseley of Hartford in October of 1785.

He also received an honorary LLD from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1799.,1781,,Held a clerkship in the Committee of Pay-Table in 1781. Served as a Member of the Committee of Pay-Table in 1782.,President of the Connecticut Constitutional Convention in 1818.,"Oliver Wolcott, Jr. was the son of Oliver and Lorana (Collins) Wolcott. His father was Governor of Connecticut and one of the signers of both the Articles of Confederation and the Declaration of Independence.   <br>Oliver Wolcott, Jr. graduated from Yale in 1778 and entered the Litchfield Law School, studying under Tapping Reeve. In 1781, he was admitted to the Bar and received a Master's degree from Yale.  <br>In the summer of 1779, Wolcott joined the quartermaster's department of the Continental Army, likely assisted by his father who was in charge of army stores and ordinance in Litchfield. His new was his first experience with what would later become his career: organizing the financial affairs of his department as well as the provision and transportation of goods for the Army.  <br>After completing his service, however, Wolcott began a prominent political rather than military career. His political appointments included the Committee of the General Assembly in 1782, followed by the Commissioner for the state of Connecticut; rising rapidly to the position of the Connecticut Comptroller in 1788 and (a year later) to Auditor in the National Treasury Department. In this position he was instrumental in structuring the new Treasury Department through the establishment of numerous clerical forms and methods.  <br>In 1791, he became the Comptroller of the United States Treasury. As such, he was a key figure the in the creation of Secretary Alexander Hamilton's First Bank of the United States. He would continue to seek Hamilton's advice in his future career. In 1795, Oliver was appointed the second Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of America by President George Washington. As Secretary, his primary duty became raising funds to support the growing Federal Government. During his time as Treasurer, he saw the introduction of the first gold coins into circulation (1975, 1796), the employment of the first women in the United States Mint (1795), designed and implemented the Customs Service Flag (1799), and the first federal tax on land, dwellings, and slaves (1798). He held the position into the administration of President John Adams, retiring in 1800 amid public controversy and criticism from the Jeffersonian supporters in Congress. Wolcott invited a congressional investigation into the Treasury in response in 1801 and although it cleared his name, Wolcott did not return to the department.  <br>Impressed with the man's service, President John Adams appointed Wolcott a federal circuit judge in the expanded judiciary department created by the Judiciary Act of 1801. The controversial act was repealed in 1802, however, before it could take effect and Wolcott never held the position.  <br>Following his retirement from government service, Wolcott moved to New York City. In April of 1803, Oliver was elected president of Merchant's Bank and held the position for a year. He went on to help found the Bank of America and was elected its first president in 1812, a position he held for two years. While in New York City, Wolcott ran several successful businesses including the Litchfield China Trading Company (when he partnered with his brother Frederick Wolcott and associates Benjamin Tallmadge and Julius Deming) and Oliver Wolcott & Company. The men of the Litchfield China Trading Company commissioned the <i>Trident</i> with funds from several successful trips of chartered vessels. These ships sailed to the Orient to purchase exotic goods to be sold in New York . Wolcott returned to Litchfield after the sale of the <i>Trident</i> and dissolution of the company in 1810, discouraged from sea trade by the prospect of war with England. Oliver Wolcott, Jr. turned to the real estate business while Frederick went into the wool manufacture business under the name Wolcott Manufacturing Company (or Litchfield Manufacturing Company) with assistance from his brother.   <br>In 1817, Oliver ran for the seat of Governor of Connecticut under the Democratic/Toleration ticket and won. He was re-elected to the position for ten consecutive years, finally ending his administration in 1827. While Governor, Wolcott presided over the creation of the State's first written constitution in 1818 which replaced the previously established Colonial Charter (the only changes being the removal of 'Crown' and 'Parliament' from the original charter). The new Constitution both expanded and curtailed the power of the Governor by giving him veto power but also giving the legislative body the power to override the veto. He also was no longer allowed to preside over the General Assembly, but did give him extensive power to appoint civil and military officials. This Constitution no longer stands and today the Governors serve under the 1965 Constitution.  <br>In 1785, he married Elizabeth Stoughton the daughter of Captain John Stoughton, who attended Yale in 1755. The couple had been married twenty years when she died of consumption on September 24, 1805 at the age of thirty-eight. They had five sons, three of whom had died in infancy, and two daughters.

Chairman of the Committee on Finance in 1945 and 1946.,Speaker of the State House of Representatives in 1825. Clerk of the State Senate in 1816.,"Levi Woodbury was a descendant of John Woodbury who emigrated to Cape Ann, MA in 1623. He was the son of Peter and Mary Woodbury. He began his legal practice in Francestown, NH in 1812. He was one of the few New England Republicans in a mostly Federalist area. He gained great popularity for an address he made against President James Madison during the War of 1812. Woodbury consequently gained much fame and political reputation at the young age of twenty-three.   <br>In 1816, the Republicans gained control of the state of New Hampshire. In 1817, Woodbury was appointed Judge of the New Hampshire state court and became known as the 'baby' judge as he was the youngest ever appointed judge in the state at the age of only twenty-seven. While serving on the bench, he helped prepare three volumes of Woodbury and Minot's New Hampshire Reports.   <br>One of his important cases while on the New Hampshire bench was <I>Merrill v. Sherburne</I>, which regarded legislative encroachment upon judicial power. Woodbury ruled that '...it is inseparable from the structure of the legislative and judicial departments, that jealousies should arise between them as the exerciseof their respective powers [but] ...though thus, situated, both ought to rejoice that the their own errors can be discovered and corrected.' His ruling stated that the legislature could not interfere with or undertake judicial functions, unless there was a 'specific constitutional sanction' for such action. This decision determined that the legislature could only interfere with judicial process and decisions in extreme cases.   <br>In 1819, Woodbury moved to Portsmouth, ME and married the daughter of Asa and Elizabeth (Wendell) Clapp of Portland ME. Asa Clapp was the wealthiest merchant in Portland, ME and a leading Republican. Elizabeth Clapp brought a dowry of $50,000 to the marraige as well as a house in Portsmouth, ME, which gave Woodbury a socially and economically secure base. This also allowed Woodbury to add a seacoast merchant base to his inland roots of support. They had four daughters and one son.   <br>In 1823, he was elected Governor of New Hampshire by the 'Young America' faction of the Democrat and Federalist parties. He was defeated for a second term as Governor, but while serving as governor, he made a speech recommending more education for women. In addition, when the New Hampshire Historical Society was formed in 1823, he was named its first Vice-President.   <br>While serving in the U.S. Senate, he became known as the 'Rock of New England Democracy.' Woodbury was an avowed isolationist and became a supporter of a 'mildly protective tariff.' During his time in the Senate, he opposed President Adams and became a Jacksonian. Woodbury also advocated the annexation of Texas and the occupation of Oregon. In 1826, he gave a major speech in opposition to the pending judiciary bill which sought to expand the U.S. Supreme Court from seven to ten members. Woodbury feared Congress would pack the court. In addition, while he did not agree with slavery as an institution, he felt that the right to abolish or preserve slavery lay in the hands of individual states.   <br>During his second term in the U.S. Senate, Woodbury spoke of the need for a Presidential veto, attacked the Whig measures of Clay and displayed an increasing belief in states' rights that would influence many of his decisions as a Supreme Court Justice. His increasing emphasis on this area made him a more appealing candidate to Southerners during this period of sectional hostility, although he was certainly not pro-Southern or pro-slavery.   <br>When he retired from the Senate, Woodbury returned to Portsmouth, NH where he wrote of recent social and political changes. As Secretary of the Navy, he reorgainized the Survey of the Coast under a scientific corps (1832). He became Secretary of the Treasury after the Senate refused to confirm Jackson's first choice of Roger B. Taney. Woodbury favored an independent treasury for the United States rather than private banks.   <br>In 1845, he was offered an ambassadorship to London which he declined. He later served as a Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court for five years during the unstable period of the Taney court of the late 1840's. He died while serving on the Supreme Court in 1851.

His brother Lewis B. Woodruff also attended the Litchfield Law School and his sister Lucy Morris Woodruff attended the Litchfield Female Academy.     Before graduating from Yale College in 1825, Woodruff attended Morris Academy. After receiving his undergraduate degree, he studied law with James Gould at the Litchfield Law School. In 1827, he was admitted to the bar and traveled to the Ohio Valley in search of a location for a new practice. Discouraged, he returned to Litchfield and opened a law office there instead later the same year.    Woodruff served in various public positions throughout his lifetime, including postmaster of Litchfield from 1832 to 1846. He served as Justice of the Peace, a Grand Juror, the town Treasurer, the town clerk, a clerk of the Superior Court, a Colonel in the Litchfield Militia, and the Judge of Probate.     Woodruff also became involved in local and national politics, was a member of the State House of Representatives in 1851, 1866, and 1874. While a state Congressman, he served as the chair of the judiciary committee and was a vital player in the 1875 revision of the statutes.    He was elected as a Democrat to the Thirty-seventh Congress (1861-1863). As a Congressman, he served on the committee on public lands, using his experience to advise on legislation regarding public lands. He lost his re-election bid in 1863 because of his affiliation with the perceived anti-war Democratic party.     Woodruff was also a local historian. In 1845, he authored a <I>History of Litchfield</I>.     In 1829, he married Henrietta Sophronia (Seymour) Woodruff, a Litchfield Female Academy graduate and the sister of Origen S. Seymour, a Law School classmate who in turn married Woodruff's sister Lucy. Woodruff and his wife had two children: George and Henrietta. George C.

His older brother, George Catlin Woodruff, was also a student at the Litchfield Law School. Woodruff attended the Litchfield Female Academy before attending Yale College for undergraduate studies (he graduated in 1830). His education culminated in his studies at the Litchfield Law School.    After Woodruff's admission to the bar, he moved to New York City where, in 1832, he partnered with Willis Hall (who graduated from Law School in 1826). Hall and Woodruff remained partners until 1836 when Woodruff practiced on his own until 1840. He then partnered with George Wood and Richard Goodman under the firm name of Woodruff & Goodman. He remained there until his election to the Court of Common Pleas. Woodruff remained in private practice until 1849 and did not return to it for twelve years.    In November, 1835, Woodruff married Harriet Burnet Hornblower. The couple had three children: Charles (1836 - 1915), Morris (1838 - 1894), and Mary (1842 - 1924). Although New York City remained his primary residence, Woodruff returned regularly to Litchfield, where all of his children were born. In 1870, he purchased Judge Reeve's house as a summer residence.    In 1849, he was elected Judge of the Court of Common Pleas, to succeed Hon. Michael Ulshoeffer, and held that office from 1850 until 1855. During his term, he gave notable construction to the Code and Mechanic's Lien law, then both new. At the close of his term of office in the Court of Common Pleas, he was elected Judge of the Superior Court, an office he held for six years (1856 - 1861).     During this time, from 1858 to 1860, he also served as president of New York University's Phi Beta Kappa chapter President. In 1860, Columbia University awarded Woodruff an honorary doctor of laws degree.    At the close of this judicial term, he resumed the private practice of his profession. Woodruff had acquired a good reputation at this point and his law firm prospered. As a trial lawyer, he was engaged in some of the most important cases of the day. He practiced with Hon. Charles F. Sanford (a Yale alum), and his son, Charles H. Woodruff, under the firm name of Sanford & Woodruff, for six years from 1862 to 1867.    In December, 1869, he was nominated by President Grant and confirmed by the Senate, to then newly created office of Judge of the Circuit Court of the United States for the Second Judicial Circuit which comprised of the states of New York, Connecticut and Vermont. He held this office until his death on September 10, 1875.

He then attended the Litchfield Law School before being admitted the State Bar of Georgia in 1835.    He spent his first year of legal practice in Crawfordville, GA. He moved to Cassville, Cherokee County, GA and practiced law there from 1836 to 1842. Wright lost his first bid for Congress in 1842, and was later defeated a second time when he ran as a Whig. From 1842 until 1849, Wright served as a judge of the superior court of the Cherokee circuit.    His first wife died in 1845 and Wright married the daughter of Nelson Allman of Chattoga County, GA shortly after that.     In 1849, he resigned his judgeship and resumed his law practice in Cassville, GA until 1855. In 1855, he moved to Rome, GA and again established a legal practice. He ran for Governor of Georgia in 1857, but lost the election. Wright was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives for one term in 1857 (until 1859). Wright went as a delegate to the Southern Commercial Convention in Montgomery, AL in 1858. Two years later he went as a delegate to the state Democratic Convention in Milledgeville, GA. He also served as a delegate to the Georgia Secession Convention and the Confederate Secession Convention.    During the Civil War, Wright staunchly supported the Southern cause and in 1860 raised a legion for the Confederate Army around Atlanta, GA. From 1861 to 1862, he served as a Colonel in the 38th Georgia Infantry of the Confederate Army (Wright's Legion). He also served in the Confederate Congress for the duration of the war. Initially, he supported a powerful Confederate government and military, but as the war progressed, he became alarmed at the emergency measures taken by the government beginning in 1862. Although Wright supported a strong, large army, he sought one of volunteers rather than draftees. He became a virulent defender of personal and property rights.     As early as February 1864, Wright began to discuss pursuing peace with President Lincoln and the North. After the war ended, he remained involved within the shaping of Georgia politics. In 1877, he acted as a member of the Georgia Constitutional Convention and helped to set the laws for Georgia.     He died at his home, Glenwood, and is buried in Myrtle Hill Cemetery in Rome, GA.

The land had been designated as a burial ground by John Young when the original land plots were designated in 1799.  Neighbors were encroaching on the cemetary land and the city wanted to protect the plots.  Charles Young compiled and issued the deed.    <br>Over the next five years the cemetary became run down and rarely used by Youngstown citizens.  The city made the decision to exume any remaining bodies and reappropriated the land (which was located in the center of the city) for use as the site of a new courthouse, jail and city office.  The buildings were completed by 1875 however, Young, upon discovering the changed use of the land, sued the city of Youngstown claiming the change in designation of the plots voided the quit claim deed.  The Ohio Circuit Court agreed with Young and awarded possession of the land back to him.

In 1810 the Beecher family moved from East Hampton to Litchfield, Connecticut when Lyman became minister of the local Congregational Church. From 1810 to 1816 Catharine attended the Litchfield Female Academy, and she became an assistant teacher at the school after completing her own education.     In 1821 she took another teaching job in New London, Connecticut, where she taught girls music and drawing for a time. She returned to Litchfield in 1822 and was interested in teaching at the Female Academy. After returning to her hometown however, her fiance Alexander Fisher died and Catherine entered a deep depression. Later that year, she opened the Hartford Female Seminary in Hartford, Connecticut. The school became very successful and widely known. In 1832, Beecher hired John Pierce Brace to replace her as principal of the school. Brace and Beecher were close friends from their time together in Litchfield, and Beecher was deeply influenced by Pierce and Brace's teaching methods (using many of them in her own school, however as Brace noted privately and publicly, she never credited the Litchfield Female Academy or Brace for the role they played in molding her theories on education).     After Brace took over as principal of the seminary in Hartford, Catharine moved to Ohio and served as the head of the Cincinnati Ladies' Seminary in 1832. In addition to her education work, Catharine also did benevolent work and was an author. Catherine's writings included cookbooks, advice books, pamphlets, newspaper articles, textbooks, and essays and always had a female audience in mind. Her most popular book, 'The American Woman's Home,' was co-written with her younger sister, Harriet Beecher Stowe.","'Rules for the School and Family' and Names of the Young Ladies belonging to Miss Pierce's School in the Summer of 1814 (Litchfield Historical Society - Litchfield Female Academy collection).  <br>In the <I>Autobiography of Lyman Beecher</I>, his daughter Catherine Beecher writes 'Miss Sarah Pierce . . .

Emily Noyes Vanderpoel, <U>Chronicles of a Pioneer School from 1792 to 1833, Being the History of Miss Sarah Pierce and Her Litchfield School</U> (1903) pp.179-180.    Beecher remarked that both male and female students read and discussed romantic novels of the day while 'romances in real life abounded on every side.'    In a letter written to Louisa Wait on January 22, 1811, Beecher commented on the broken engagement of Litchfield Female Academy student Sarah Gilbert saying that her family lost it's fortune 'by her Uncle's failure' and that 'as soon as Alexander heard of it he <U>left her</U>...There <U>was</U> a kind & generous heart that would not have forsaken the afflicted & the orphan in her utmost need.”    Schlesinger Library - Beecher-Stowe Collection    On April 13, 1819, Catharine Beecher wrote to Samuel Foote about Theodosia Deveaux Hastings and William Woodbridge Petit's wedding:     “The Mr. Petit that married Theodosia was originally from Marietta, Ohio. They were married at our house & I like Petit much -- tho’ he is an odd sort of genius -- in some things.

I fear it will be some years before I see her again & I feel the separation very much for she was a lovely girl & very dear to me.”     In that same letter, Catharine also wrote about a planned trip to Maine and Boston with her “mother’s sister Lucy” [Porter].     “She is a lovely girl about my age & has spent the winter here. She will be married next fall to Mr. John Brace & will settle here which will be a great comfort to mama & all of us…'     Stowe-Day Acquisitions  ",,Educator;Arts,Hartford/CT/United States;Cincinnati/OH/United States,,,,1810-1816,Catharine Beecher Poem;Beecher Family Photograph;Catharine Esther Beecher Photograph;Litchfield Female Academy Collection;Drawing of Rev.

3210,Lyman Beecher,,,M,,,,,1775,1863,Yale (1793-1795),,,,,"A Presbyterian clergyman, Lyman Beecher (1775-1863) was one of the outstanding American preachers and revivalists before the Civil War. He achieved national fame as reformer, educator, and central figure in theological controversies. Lyman Beecher was born on Oct. 12, 1775, at New Haven, Conn. Son of a blacksmith, he was raised on a farm. Beecher entered Yale in 1793. The college president, Timothy Dwight, greatly influenced his religious beliefs and enthusiasm for revivalism. In 1799 he was ordained as pastor of the Presbyterian Church at East Hampton, Long Island, N. Y. Dynamic preaching and a published sermon against dueling earned him a modest reputation, and in 1810 he accepted the more prestigious pulpit of the Congregational Church of Litchfield, Conn. For 16 years at Litchfield he attracted large crowds, and his influence extended beyond his own congregation. Persons warmed by his revivals were urged to support a growing list of voluntary societies and moral reforms, especially temperance. His defense of orthodox Christianity against Unitarianism in Connecticut was noted by church leaders, and he was invited to move to Boston, where he could be even more effective in that cause. In 1826 Beecher became pastor of the Hanover Street Church of Boston. His efforts again resulted in spiritual awakening, and his reputation for defending orthodoxy against Unitarianism became widespread. During his years in Boston he edited a monthly, the Spirit of the Pilgrims. A fear of Catholicism began to emerge and led him to share in the nativist attack on that faith. When he was invited to return to Presbyterianism to become the president and professor of theology of the new Lane Theological Seminary at Cincinnati, Ohio, his concern to Christianize the West and educate ministers for that task was linked to his desire to counteract growing Catholic influence in the Ohio Valley. The sense of purpose he felt in moving to Cincinnati in 1832 was well expressed in his A Plea for the West (1835). Until 1843 he also served as pastor of the Second Presbyterian Church there. Despite his incentive and characteristic vigor, Beecher's years at Cincinnati were an unhappy climax to his career. A disruptive debate over slavery in 1834 so divided students and faculty that it took years for Lane Seminary to recover. Although he favored the antislavery cause, Beecher was not an abolitionist and preferred gradual emancipation. With strange irony in 1835 he was tried twice for heresy by conservative Presbyterians who found his orthodoxy too liberal. A trial by the Presbyterian General Assembly was avoided, but his position had contributed to a major schism in that denomination by 1838. Beecher remained at Lane until 1850. The last years of his life were spent in Brooklyn, N.Y., where he died on Jan. 10, 1863.    Beecher provided a lively and social atmosphere at his boarding house for Litchfield Female Academy students.",,Lyman Beecher old.jpg,,,,,,,Religious Calling,,,Harriet Porter Beecher/1817;Roxana Foote Beecher/1799,,,"Congregational Church Architectural Fragments;John Cotton Smith letters;Lyman Beecher Papers;Benjamin Tallmadge Letter;Lyman Beecher Photograph;Beecher Family Photograph;Photograph of Lyman Beecher, Henry Ward Beecher and Harriet Beecher Stowe;Engraving of Lyman Beecher;Drawing of Rev.

3227,Harriet Beecher Stowe,,Harriet Elizabeth Beecher,F,,Litchfield,CT,United States,"June 14, 1811",1896,,,,,,"Harriet Beecher Stowe, daughter of the Reverend Lyman Beecher and Roxana Foote, attended the Litchfield Female Academy from 1820 until 1824. In 1836 she married Calvin Stowe, a minister and teacher and they had seven children together. Harriet taught at the Hartford Female Seminary which had been founded by her sister Catharine Beecher and after moving to Cincinnati in 1834, taught at the Western Female Institute which had also been founded by her sister.   <br>While she wrote at least ten adult novels, Harriet Beecher Stowe is predominantly known for her first, <I>Uncle Tom's Cabin</I> (1852). Begun as a serial for the Washington anti-slavery weekly, <I>The National Era</I>, it focused public interest on the issue of slavery, and was deeply controversial. In writing the book, Stowe drew on her personal experience. She was familiar with slavery, the antislavery movement, and the underground railroad because Kentucky -- across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, Ohio, where Stowe had lived -- was a slave state. Following publication of the book, she became a celebrity, speaking against slavery both in America and Europe. She wrote <I>A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin</I> (1853) extensively documenting the realities on which the book was based, to refute critics who tried to argue that it was inauthentic; and published a second anti-slavery novel, <I>Dred</I> in 1856. In 1862, when she visited President Lincoln, legend claims that he greeted her as 'the little lady who made this big war': the war between the states. <I>Uncle Tom's Cabin</I> went on to be published in twenty different languages and sold over 500,000 copies in the first five years of publication.   <br>Around 1860 she and her husband purchased land in Florida and began vacationing there.

Regarding evening parties    Harriet Beecher Stowe, <U>Poganuc People: Their Loves and Lives</U> (1878) p. 137.    'The walls were hung with paper imported from France and ornamented with family portraits by Copley. In the fireplace, the high brass andirons sustained a magnificent fire, snapping and sparkling and blazing in a manner gorgeous to behold. Soon Cato came in with on a waiter, followed by Venus, his wife, who with a high white turban on her head and a clear-starched white apron in front, bore after him a tray laden with delicate rolls, sandwiches, and multiplied and tempting varieties of cake. Dolly spread her handkerchief in her little lap, and comported herself as nearly as possible as she saw the grand ladies doing, who, in satin and velvet and point lace, were making themselves agreeable, and taking their tea with elegant ease.'    Regarding the tea parties at the 'Davenports' (really the Tallmadges in Litchfield).   Harriet Beecher Stowe, <U>Poganuc People: Their Loves and Lives</U> (1878) pp. 90.    Teas began at 6pm and ended with the 'nine o'clock bell' which caused 'an immediate rustle of dresses, and rising, and shaking of hands, and cutting short of stories, and uttering of last words...'    'For though not exactly backed by the arbitrary power which enforced the celebrated curfew, yet the nine o'clock bell was one of the authoritative institutions of New England; and as its sound all obediently set their faces homeward, to rake up house-fires, put out candles, and say their prayers before going to rest.'    Harriet Beecher Stowe, <U>Poganuc People: Their Loves and Lives</U> (1878) pp. 94.     Stowe recalled 'domestic concerts.'    'The tea parties of Poganuc were not wanting in subjects for conversation. It was a rule to discuss the current literature of the day, which at that time came from across the water -- the last articles in the <U>Edinburgh Review</U>, the latest Waverly novel, the poetry of Moore, Byron, Southey, and Wadsworth -- all came under review and had a place of consideration.'     Regarding the intellectual aspect of social life.  Harriet Beecher Stowe, <U>Poganuc People: Their Loves and Lives</U> (1878)     'In those days, when newspapers were few and scanty, when places were isolated and travel was tedious and uncertain, the intellectual life of cultivated people was intense. A book was an event in Poganuc. It was heard of first across the ocean, and watched for, as one watches for the rising of a new planet. While the English packet was slowly laboring over, bearing it to our shores, expectation was rising, and when the book was to be found in the city book stores an early copy generally found its way to the elite circle of Poganuc.     Regarding the intellectual aspect of social life.  Harriet Beecher Stowe, <U>Poganuc People: Their Loves and Lives</U> (1878)     'Never in this day -- generation of jaded and sated literary appetite -- will any one know the fresh and eager joy, the vivid sensation of delight with which a poem like 'The Lady of the Lake,' a novel like 'Ivanhoe,' was received in lonely mountain towns by a people eager for a new mental excitement.'     Regarding the intellectual aspect of social life.  Harriet Beecher Stowe, <U>Poganuc People: Their Loves and Lives</U> (1878)     Beecher referred to a Judge Belcher of Tapping Reeve as 'an authority in literary criticism,' who would 'hold the ear of the drawing-room while he ran a parallel between the dramatic handling of Scott's characters as compared with those of Shakespeare, or gave an analysis of the principles of the Lake School of Poetry.'    '[The Litchfield youth] had their reading circles and their literary personalities -- some being partisans of Byron, some of Scott, etc. -- and there was much innocent spouting of poetry.'    At a party in August 1814, John Pierce Brace, Harriet Tallmadge, and Henry Sheldon debated 'upon the merits of some modern novels.'    At a party in 1814 at Sarah Pierce's house, John Pierce Brace and other law students debated some of the Litchfield Female Academy students in 'a warm dispute upon the question whether highly immoral poetry could possess practical merit.' John Pierce Brace and Edward King took the 'affirmative,' joined by the girls, while Sarah and Mary Pierce and law student Andrew Dewitt Bruyn argued the negative.'    At a party in 1814 at Sarah Pierce's house, law student Edward King read <U>Hamlet</U> aloud.    Beecher said young people were deeply influenced by the romantic poetry and novels of Byron, Scott, etc.     'There were promising youths who tied their open shirt collars with a black ribbon, and professed disgust at the hollow state of human happiness in general, and there were compassionate young ladies who considered the said young men all the more interesting for this state of mysterious desolation, and often succeeded in the work of consoling them.'

3229,Henry Ward Beecher,,,M,,Litchfield,CT,United States,"June 24, 1813",1887,Attended Mount Pleasant Institute  Graduated from Amherst College in 1832,,,,,"Henry Ward Beecher, son of the Reverend Lyman Beecher and Roxana Foote Beecher of Litchfield, Connecticut, attended Sarah Pierce's Female Academy in 1824. At the age of 13, Lyman moved his family to Boston, and Henry began attending the Mount Pleasant Institute in Amherst, Massachusetts. After completing his studies at Mount Pleasant, Henry began his studies at Amherst College, and graduated in 1832. Henry then joined his family in Cincinnati, Ohio where he began to prepare for the ministry at Lane Seminary. After completing his studies, he married Eunice Bullard, who he had met in Amherst, and the couple moved to Lawrenceburg, Indiana where Henry began his career and the couple began their family that would include 11 children. Two years after their move to Lawrenceburg, they relocated to Indianapolis where Henry pursued better pay. After struggling to make ends meet he accepted a job offer in Brooklyn, New York in 1847 where he became very well known for his anti-temperance, anti-slavery, and pro-woman's suffrage sermons. Beecher's fame on the lecture circuit led to his becoming editor of several religious magazines, and he received large advances for a novel and for a biography of Jesus.    He was originally part of the free soil movement but eventually became a Republican. In 1860 Henry went down South and purchased a slave, 'pinky,' for $900 and brought her up to his congregation in Brooklyn. After a sermon and imitating a slave auctioneer 'pinky' was freed. In 1927 she returned to the parish to talk about what happened. Her name, now married, was Mrs. Rose War Hunt.     In the highly publicized scandal known as the Beecher-Tilton Affair he was tried on charges that he had committed adultery with a friend's wife, Elizabeth Tilton. In 1870, Elizabeth had confessed to her husband, Theodore Tilton, that she had had a relationship with Henry Ward Beecher. Tilton was then fired from his job at <I>The Independent</I> because of his editor's fears of adverse publicity. Theodore and Henry both pressured Elizabeth to recant her story, which she did, in writing.    The charges became public when Theodore Tilton told Elizabeth Cady Stanton of his wife's confession. Stanton repeated the story to fellow women's rights leaders Victoria Woodhull and Isabella Beecher Hooker.    Henry Ward Beecher had publicly denounced Woodhull's advocacy of free love. She published a story in her paper (<I>Woodhull and Claflin's Weekly</I>) on November 2, 1872, claiming that America's most renowned clergyman was secretly practicing the free-love doctrines which he denounced from the pulpit. The story created a national sensation. As a result, Woodhull was arrested in New York City and imprisoned for sending obscene material through the mail. The Plymouth Church held a board of inquiry and exonerated Beecher, but excommunicated Mr. Tilton in 1873.    Tilton then sued Beecher. The trial began in January 1875, and ended in July when the jurors deliberated for six days but were unable to reach a verdict. His wife loyally supported him throughout the ordeal.    A second board of inquiry was held at Plymouth Church and this body also exonerated Beecher. Two years later, Elizabeth Tilton once again confessed to the affair and the church excommunicated her. Despite this Beecher continued to be a popular national figure. However, the debacle split his family. While most of his siblings supported him, Isabella Beecher Hooker openly supported one of his accusers.    Henry Ward Beecher died of a cerebral hemorrhage on March 8, 1887. Brooklyn, still an independent city, declared a day of mourning. The state legislature recessed, and telegrams of condolence were sent by national figures, including President Cleveland. His funeral procession to Plymouth Church -- led by a Black commander of the William Lloyd Garrison Post in Massachusetts and a Virginia Confederate general and former slaveholder, marching arm in arm -- paid tribute to what Beecher helped accomplish. Henry Ward Beecher was laid to rest in Brooklyn's Green-Wood Cemetery on March 11, 1887, survived by his wife Eunice, and four of the nine children born to them: Harriet, Henry, William, and Herbert.

3230,Eunice Bullard Beecher,,,F,,West Sutton,MA,United States,1812,1897,,,,,,"In 1812, Eunice Bullard White was born in West Sutton, Massachusetts. She married Henry Ward Beecher in 1837, and moved to Indiana with her husband immediately after her marriage. Henry Beecher was later to become a well-known Presbyterian minister, and for the first ten years of his career he would serve two churches in Indiana. The first church he served was the First Presbyterian Church in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, on the banks of the Ohio River. Indiana had become a state just two decades earlier, and it still had the rawness of a newly settled territory. While Eunice Beecher enjoyed the comforts of her life back East, she was excited and more than willing to embark with her new husband to this unfamiliar territory in order to support him in his ministry.    This enthusiasm and eagerness would soon fade to disappointment as she realized that a minister’s wife did not have the dignity and respect associated with the same position back home, and that she was expected to fill many demanding roles, none of which were familiar to her. Her disappointment with Indiana was apparent in her writing of 'From Dawn to Daylight; or, The Simple Story of a Western Home' The novel centered on Mr. and Mrs. George and Mary Herbert, who traveled to Indiana to start a new life through the ministry. This novel, published by a minister’s wife, was a thinly disguised autobiography of Beecher’s own experiences in this unfamiliar land. Not only were her new roles as a bride, a mother, and a minister’s wife difficult to adjust to, but the land itself proved to have an influence on Beecher’s rather discontented outlook on this challenging lifestyle.     In 1847, after ten years in Indiana, the Beechers left Indianapolis for Brooklyn, New York. Twelve years later, Beecher published From Dawn to Daylight, which caused such a sensation that it was effectively banned in Indianapolis, because of what citizens felt was a negative portrayal of themselves and their city. The novel was quite the contrary, with honest and frank descriptions of the city and the land. In fact, after her move back East, Beecher referred to their term in Indianapolis as being “a very happy home – for many reasons the happiest we ever knew'    (This information was taken from the website Our Land, Our Literature created by Ball State University.)     She continued to write articles, chiefly on domestic subjects, to various periodicals. Some of her articles were published in book form. Eunice Beecher stood by her husband faithfully during his sensational adultery trial in 1874.  She died in 1897.

She completed her studies in Litchfield around 1811. In 1821, when Hylah was 26, she married Levi Hasbrouck. Levi and Hylah spent the rest of their lives at Locust Lawn, a farm located in Gardner, New York which Levi had inherited from his father, Josiah Hasbrouck, upon Josiah's death in 1821.<br>Levi and Hylah had seven children, five of whom survived to adulthood. Their first daughter, Sarah Maria, was born in November 1823. A second daughter, Ann Bevier, was born in 1827. A son, Josiah, named for his paternal grandfather, was born in 1825 but lived for only four years; Josiah's death may have been expected for a second son, born in 1828 while his brother was still alive, was also named Josiah. The Hasbrouck's had two more daughters, Louisa, born in 1831, and Laura Tallmadge, born in 1834. <br>Hylah was a member of the Ladies' Mount Vernon Association of the Union, the Foreign Missionary Society and the Ulster County Agricultural Society. The family belonged to the Dutch Reformed Churches at New Paltz and Hurley. Trade cards and invoices indicate Hylah's interest in home furnishings and she often shopped at specialty shops in New York City. <br>Hylah's husband, Levi, died at home on March 7, 1861, aged 70. Levi left the farm to his son Josiah but provided in his will that Hylah should remain at Locust Lawn and she should also have the use of 'the old stone house at New Paltz Village.' She was awarded pew 39 at the Dutch Reformed Church in New Paltz. After Levi's death, Hylah remained at Locust Lawn along with her two unmarried daughters, Louisa, then 33 and Laura, 31. Her son, Josiah, nominally supervised the farm but he traveled frequently and actually spent most of his time away from the farm. Hylah died at the age of 79 in 1874 and her funeral was held at Locust Lawn. <br>The bequests listed in her will reflect her interest in religious organizations. She provided for gifts to the American Bible Society in New York, The American Tract Company in New York, the Foreign Missions Society and the Dutch Reformed Church in New Paltz. There were additional gifts to the Board of Domestic Missions and to the General Synod of the Reformed Dutch Church to be used for the education of 'indigent young men preparing for the gospel ministry.' The fund was to be known as the Louisa Hasbrouck Scholarship. She provided for other family members including the children of her deceased daughter Sarah, her nieces and her namesakes, who by 1871 numbered five women or girls named Hylah. Also provided was a bequest to the Dutch Church 'to be used for paying for the bread and wine at the communion as is necessary to put away the necessity of a collection on that day' for she had 'often been so horrified after the solemn scene to hear the rattling of money.'","Bevier, Katherine. <I>The Bevier Family</I>.

3427,Lydia Booth,,,F,,Poughkeepsie,NY,United States,"May 17, 1803","November 6, 1854",,,,,,"Born in Poughkeepsie, New York on March 17, 1803, Lydia Booth was the daughter of George Booth, a wool manufacturer, and Mary Armstrong Booth. After her mother's death her father re-married Maria Vassar (the sister of Matthew Vassar). From 1814 to 1815, Lydia attended Sarah Pierce’s Female Academy in Litchfield, Connecticut, where she received rigorous academic and religious training. It was probably at Miss Pierce’s school that Booth acquired the intellectual interests that prompted her to suggest that her uncle establish an institution of higher education for women. Miss Pierce firmly adhered to the notion of “Republican Motherhood” which held that women are responsible for their children’s moral and intellectual instruction and thus should receive advanced education. Booth’s obituary in the Poughkeepsie Eagle noted that Miss Pierce’s instructions “left their ineffaceable influence in her [Booth’s] heart and life - her manners and purpose – through all her subsequent years.” After Litchfield, Booth returned to Poughkeepsie where she taught at a “family school,” instructing her siblings and neighbors’ children. She then attended a finishing school in New York City. In 1824 Booth moved to Virginia and taught in Tappahanock and Fredericksburg, returning to Poughkeepsie in 1837 to open what would later be called the Poughkeepsie Female Seminary. The seminary offered classes in algebra and geometry, subjects not usually offered at women’s schools of that time. When the seminary outgrew its first site, Matthew Vassar purchased a building on Garden Street where Booth established Cottage Hill Seminary, in which he took a spirited interest, visiting it often. In 1845 Vassar traveled in Europe, examining a number of hospitals with the intention of establishing one himself when he returned to Poughkeepsie. In her correspondence with him, however, his niece urged him to establish a college for women instead. How, she asked, could women train their children if they did not have an education themselves? Vassar later attributed “the early direction of my mind for the enlarged education of women' to his relationship with his niece. Lydia Booth died on November 6, 1854, before her uncle, still intent on endowing a hospital, had taken any definite steps towards the establishment of a women’s college. However, in the Spring of 1855, having come to Poughkeepsie from Alabama where he had established a similar institution, Professor Milo P. Jewett purchased and reopened Cottage Hill Seminary. Jewett joined the Central Baptist Church where Vassar worshipped, and Jewett soon suggested, apparently independently of Booth, that Vassar endow a college for women. Because of Booth’s early encouragement of her uncle to establish a women’s college, Vassar's legendary Professor of History Lucy M. Salmon called her “the real founder of Vassar College.” Vassar himself did not acknowledge Booth until well after the college’s founding when, in an address to the trustees on February 23, 1864, he set the record straight, 'It is due to truth to say that my great interest on the subject of female education was awakened not less than twenty years ago by an intimate female friend and relative, now deceased, who conducted a seminary of long standing and character in this city . . . It was this fact, more than any other, and more than all others, that awakened me early to the possibility and necessity of an institution like the one we now propose.'",'Rules for the School and Home' and Names of the Young Ladies belonging to Miss Pierce's School in the Summer of 1814 (Litchfield Historical Society - Litchfield Female Academy collection).,,,,,,,,Educator,Tappanhanock/VA/United States;Fredericksburg/VA/United States;Poughkeepsie/NY/United States,,,,1814-1815,Litchfield Female Academy Collection,

He was a remarkably fleshy man. She was about my age, perhaps a little younger. I do not remember much of her until I left college. I then found her sharing with Harriet Talmadge [sic] the credit of being the belle of Litchfield. She was a very graceful beautiful and gay girl, a first rate dancer and dressed with a great deal of taste. She was engaged once, but the gentleman very dishonorably deserted her, and she always refused all offers after that. When she became religious she became one of the most interesting young ladies of my acquaintance. For several years, I taught her in the evenings, Latin, Arithmetic etc. She was then Drawing Teacher in our School. In 1831, she boarded in my family during the winter, and was a very agreeable member of the family. The spring of that year, she came to Hartford, as teacher in the Seminary [Hartford Female Seminary]; she was here when I took it in 1831 and continued in it until 1842, when I was obliged to dismiss all the teachers, there were so few scholars. She now lives with her brother, here. At the age of 40, she was the finest looking woman in Hartford.'

Raised in Hartford, his family had a long history in the cabinet and clock making industries.  His grandfather Benjamin Cheney was a Hartford furniture maker and his father was a clockmaker.      Cheney moved to Litchfield in 1799 and opened a shop on West Street just off the Village Green.  He quickly became one of the most sought after tradesmen in town making furniture for Tapping Reeve, Benjamin Tallmadge and Julius Deming.      The business became so successful Cheney was able to support several journeymen and hire specialists in carriage making and veneering.  His shop on West Street was listed as one of the largest craftsmen shops in town consisting of two stories.   He continued to make furniture up until his death in 1821.      Despite Cheney’s prolific production of furniture, he was not immune from the challenges of operating a business in the early 19th century.  In addition to making furniture, Cheney did odd jobs, made utilitarian items such as rake handles and clapboard, and repaired or refitted furniture.

In 1820, Litchfeld Female Academy student Mary Ann Wolcott was romantically attached to Litchfield Law School student Henry Walter Livingston, whose family belonged to the old NY grant, Manor families (considered the closest thing to “aristocracy in the US”). Despite Mary Ann's own distinguished background ( it didn't meet the Livingston family's marital criteria and Henry ultimately ended the relationship. This caused a stir in the community and many students weighed in on the breakup via journal entries and letters.     Abigail wrote to William Greene:     “Since I wrote to you there have been several new engagements in this place. Mary Ann Wolcott is engaged to Mr. Henry Livingston a very elegant man in appearance with two hundred thousand dollars and Lord of the Manor. He is not overstocked with sense but sufficient to please her, what a satirical remark.”     William replied to Abigail on July 13, 1820 that the engagement only proved love was irrational and unpredictable. Evidently a long engagement was planned, which raised a red flag for William: “You ask me if I think Miss M ___ W’s ___ sentiments capable of constancy for two long years.

During this time Seth hand-copied a set of Tapping Reeve's law notes for his own use, but never attended the Litchfield Law School as a student (a common misconception). Once his understanding of the law was adequate. Seth passed the bar in Litchfield in 1799, and then immediately opened a law office of his own in New Haven and commenced practice. In that same year he married Catharine Wales Staples. During their marriage the couple had six children; three sons and three daughters, one daughter of which later attended the Litchfield Female Academy. The future Yale Law School formed in the New Haven law office of Seth P. Staples. Staples owned an exceptional library (an attraction for students at a time when law books were scarce), and he began training apprentices in the early 1800s. By the 1810s his law office had a full-fledged law school. Samuel Hitchcock, one of Staples’ former students, became a partner at the office and later, the proprietor of the New Haven Law School. While practicing in Connecticut Staples was elected a member of the Connecticut Academy of the Arts and Sciences, and was a representative of the town of New Haven in the State Legislature seven or eight sessions, most of them during the war of 1812.

He was a son of Supply Strong, one of the, first settlers of Litchfield, where he was born on the 7th of Nov'r. 1738. In 1761, he graduated at Yale College, and first studied divinity, but soon abandoned it for the profession of law. He became a member of the bar of this county, but, being constantly in some public station for   many years thereafter, he had little or no business before the Courts.     In 1771, Mr. Strong was elected a Member of the Connecticut House of Representatives, and held a seat in that body for thirty regular sessions — during several of which he was Clerk of the House. In 1774, he was chosen a Member of the Continental Congress. In 1780, the Legislature appointed him   a Judge of the County Court, an office which he held for eleven years. In the mean time he had been elected to the Council, or Upper House of the Legislature, in place of which the Senate has since been constituted. In all of these honorable public employments he appears to have given general satisfaction, both to the Government and to the people.     'At a town meeting of the inhabitants of Litchfield, legally warned, held on the 3 1st of August 1770, — Mr. Abraham Kilborw, Moderator — It was Voted to chose a Committee to attend the General Meeting of the Mercantile and Landed   Interests of the Colony, at New Haven, on the day after the Commencement. Jedediah Strong, Esq., and Capt. John Osborn, were chosen said Committee.'     In 1774 and '75, he was appointed a member of the Revolutionary 'Committee of Inspection,'' in connection with Oliver Wolcott, James Morris, Seth Bird, Abraham Kilborn, Andrew Adams, Abraham Bradley, and others.     At the commencement of the Revolution, Mr, Strong was appointed by the General Court, a Commissary of Supplies for the Army. In April, 1775, the Governor and Council sent him to Albany with a special commission to secure all ' the arms belonging to this colony, left theie during the French War, and return them as soon as might be.' In the spring of the following year, the Legislature selected him as one of a committee 'to procure ,£1,800 in specie, in exchange for bills, and pay the same to the Governor for the use of the Northern Army, on a request of Congress.' During the period of the disaffection in the army in 1777, complaint was made to the Legislature against several militia officers in Litchfield county : and Jedediah Strong, Capt. John Watson, Reuben Smith, and   H. Fitch, were appointed a committee ' to examine the facts and report to the Assembly.'     In 1788 he was chosen a Delegate to the Convention which adopted the Constitution of the United States. Judge Strong was also conspicuous in all matters of local interest in the town. He was Town Clerk for sixteen years —   a Lister and Inspector for six years — a Selectman for thirteen years — besides being a Constable, Grand Juror, Surveyor, &c.     The first wife of Judge Strong was Ruth Patterson, to whom he was married on the 17th of April 1774. She having died, he was married to Susannah, daughter of the Hon. George Wyllys, of Hartford, (Secretary of State,) on the 22d of January, 1788. Previous to this last date, his popularity had begun to wane. By our town records it appears (hat committees were appointed to oppose certain claims of his against the town — and subsequently a committee was chosen to prosecute him for alleged 'dues to the town.' He had scarcely been married a year, before his young wife petitioned the General Court for a divorce, on the ground of intemperance, personal abuse, &c. ; and her petition was granted. In 1789 he resigned the office of Town Clerk ' at the particular request of the Selectmen.' — and after the year 1791, he appears to have lived in obscurity and poverty until his death in 1802: His remains were interred in the burying -ground west of the village of Litchfield, but no stone was ever erected to his memory. He left one daughter, who died unmarried.'    Kilbourne's book left out a few details. Jedediah Strong petitioned the state for divorce prior to his wife's petition. His was rejected. At the end of his life, an overseer was appointed to care for his affairs. It is said that Strong's case was one of the reasons for the founding of Litchfield's early temperance society.",,,"Kilbourne, Payne Kenyon, <I>A biographical history of the county of Litchfield, Connecticut: comprising biographical sketches of distinguished natives and residents of the county; together with complete lists of the judges of the county court, justices of the quorum, county commissioners, judges of probate, sheriffs, senators, &c. from the organization of the county to the present time (<A href='http://books.google.com/books?id=b_EnAQAAMAAJ&dq=%22jedediah+strong%22+a+biographical+history+litchfield&source=gbs_navlinks_s'>Google eBook</A>)</I> Clark, Austin & co., 1851",,,,,,Lawyer;Political Office,,,Ruth Paterson Strong/1774;Susannah Wyllys/1788,,,Pierce family correspondence;Jedediah Strong Collection,

Their horse had tired out, so that Nancy Starkweather, Mary Griswold and Mary Bulkley who would not stay, came up, partly on foot, and partly in the cutter leaving the other girls at a tavern under the protection of Alexander McLachlan (a little boy). Father would not let me go. Today I hear a vast many different stories that I do not know which I believe. Some say they wanted to stay & some say they did not. After meeting they came up.' (JPB Journal January 12, 1812) Later upon hearing of her marriage to George, John Pierce Brace made this comment in his journal, 'volatile * Coquettish, her love of pleasure I should suppose could never permit her to sit quietly down as the mistress of a family and give up the pleasure of vanity & conquest which have so long actuated her . . . I cannot conceive how she will behave as a wife when as a girl her feelings & practice were so flightly & thoughless.' (JPB Journal 1814) John Pierce Brace contradicts this statement however later in life when writing his History of My Poetry Vol. II. There he says of Cornelia, 'Cornelia Van Kleek was from Poughkeepsie, a sister of Sally Ann she had a very bright beautiful face. Her eyes were black & sparkling, and the whole expression of the face that of good natured fun. She loved mischief howeve and was an imprudent girl. Shew as a great flirt. I was a very good friend of hers, and in her confidence. I corresponded with her for some time. She came to Litchfield Nov. 1810 and stayed two years. She married a New York man by the name of Somervandyke who proved an inefficient man. Cornelia became an energetic woman & supported her family by taking borders.

",,,,,,"<I>Litchfield Enquirer</I>. April 13, 1916  <br>'MRS. KILBOURN DEAD. Litchfield's Oldest Inhabitant Passes Away at the Age of Ninety-Six Years and Nearly Eight Months.  <br>Mrs. Harriet D. Kilbourn, the oldest resident of Litchfield, died at her home on North street, at eleven o'clock on Tuesday morning. The funeral will be held from the house on Thursday at 2.30 o'clock, the Rev. Dr. Goodwin officiating. Internment will be in the plot in East cemetery. The honorary bearers will be George M. Woodruff, C.W. Hinsdale, Dr. C.N. Warner, A.E. Fuller, F.M. Coe and Wm. T. Marsh.  <br>Mrs. Harriet D. Kilbourn was born on West street, Litchfield, August 24th, 1819. Her father was James C. Wadsworth, of the famous Connecticut family of that name, and her mother, Sally Cooke of Danbury. Her grandfather was Col. Cooke of Danbury, a Revolutionary fighter, very closer to Washington, who had entertained 'The Father of his Country,' Lafayette, Rochambeau and many other noted men of that time, at his home in Danbury.  <br>When she was only a few months old Mrs. Kilbourn's parents moved from West street to the house where she died and that has been her home ever since, excepting about seven years when she lived in Danbury. The house was originally the store of Col. Benjamin Tallmadge and here, while he was Postmaster, was the Post office, but the Colonel altered it into a dwelling house. Mrs. Kilbourn well remembered that celebrated Revolutionary hero, the friend of Washington and the man who was given the custody the unfortunate Andre. She also attended his funeral and said the text of the sermon was the first verse of the twentieth Psalm: 'Help, Lord; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.'  <br>In her childhood Mrs. Kilbourn attended Miss Pierce's famous school for girls and well remembered Miss Sally Pierce, though not in the room where she taught. Later she was under the instruction of Dr. Brace, before he went to Hartford. It was about this time that the terrible cholera scourge of 1832 held New York in its grip and it was mighty interesting to listen to Mrs. Kilbourn's description of the fear of the girls in the school and how cucumbers particularly were 'taboo' all through this region.  <br>In 1835, Mrs. Kilbourn went with her parent to Danbury to live, but remained there only about seven years, when she returned to Litchfield and was married June 25th, 1844, to Charles J. Kilbourn, who died a little less than nine years later.  <br>Mrs. Kilbourn had a remarkably sweet voice, and was in great demand as a singer for concerts in all this vicinity. She was a member of the late Hon. Robbins Battell's celebrated 'Litchfield County Choral Union' and for years sang in the choir of the Congregational church here, of which she was a member for over 63 years, having first united with the Congregational church in Danbury in 1842.  <br>One of the many things of special local interest, that Mrs. Kilbourn well remembered is the old 'meeting house,' in which Lyman Beecher preached and which stood a few rods south of the United States Hotel, and saw the steeple fall when it was torn down. Litchfield's celebrated merchant, Julius Deming, grandfather of Clarence Deming, was a familiar figure to her and she knew well the sad story of Charlie Byington, which was printed in the Enquirer about seven years ago. In fact she was a walking and talking history of Litchfield, Connecticut and the United States, for the last eighty-five years and you could learn more of real interest concerning this town and country from her than from any book ever written. She talked most entertainingly; was always glad to see her friends and her writing was like copper plate.  <br>It is a singular fact that Mrs. Kilbourn was the eldest of seven children and the last one left. The first thing she remembered was running away, so as to see her long curls fly in the wind and then being tied up to the door latch as a punishment.  <br>Mrs. Kilbourn had traveled in all sorts of public conveyances from the old fashioned stage coach to the modern automobile.  <br>Until the last few years, when rheumatism has interfered with her getting out, Mrs. Kilbourn was most active in social and religious life of our town. She was always the 'friend in need' and though she was the last of her generation in Litchfield her heart was as warm, her brain as keen and her faculties as alert as ever. She was indeed a wonderful woman and one whom it was a rare treat to have had the privilege of knowing.'",,,Danbury/CT/United States;Litchfield/CT/United States,,"Charles J.

In 1805 she attended Sarah Pierce's Female Academy. While attending the Litchfield Female Academy she boarded at the Lyman Beecher house. She returned to the Beecher house around 1816 to teach music at the LFA. She shared a room with Catherine Beecher and they became close personal friends. Louisa taught music at the LFA from 1816 to 1821. She also taught in Philadelphia. At some point prior to 1818, Louisa became secretly engaged to Uriel Holmes, Jr. the son of Judge Holmes of Litchfield. After graduating from Yale in 1816 and beginning the study of theology at the Andover Seminary, Holmes returned to Litchfield and died of consumption in 1818.   <br>By 1819, Louisa was known to be romantically involved with William Tracy Gould, the son of James Gould, a teacher at the Law School. William had just graduated from Yale and was a current student at the Law School in Litchfield. He was several years younger than Louisa. Fanny Lyman, a student at the Female Academy wrote to William Greene in June of 1820, 'William Gould is supposed to be engaged to Louisa Wait... he has treated her with marked attention for a year past and has been told of the disadvantage resulting from such attention but he still persists in his visits to and it is now believed by everyone to be a match.' In 1821, William left Litchfield and went to Clinton, GA to establish a legal practice. The engagement continued until 1824 when Louisa was at that time living in Philadelphia and William was in Augusta, GA. However, by October of that year, William was married to his first wife Anna McKinne.     Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote about Gould and Louisa's failed relationship in her personal correspondence.   (LTB thesis, VI, p.517 ff.)    <br>Louisa became consumptive soon afterwards and died at her sister's home in Burlington, VT in 1826. John Pierce Brace said of Louisa, 'Louisa Wait was a little younger than myself & had been at Litchfield school for some time. She was the daughter of Capt. Thomas Wait of New London, who died not far from this time and left his family poor. Louisa was a slight figure, pretty features, pleasent blue eyes and with an uncommon fresh blooming complexion. She was called very pretty. She left school soon after. On August 10, 1816 she makes her apperance once more in my private journal, she then came on to be Music mistress at our School. She continued in that station until some time in 1821. She became engaged to Wm. T. Gould, who was much younger than she. After leaving Litchfield, she taught school in Philadelphia. Upon Gould's desertion of her, she fell into a consumption and died. She passed through Litchfield when sick, in 1824 and died at her sister's in Burlington in 1826. She was talented, amiable & a beautiful girl, a very great friend of mine and of Lucy's.' (John Pierce Brace, <I>History of My Poetry, Vol 1</I> Helga J.

She was the youngest of Mary Paterson Pierce and John Pierce’s seven children. Sarah’s mother died when she was only three years old. Her father remarried two years later and had three more children with his new wife. The Pierce children were frequently surrounded by highly educated individuals, as John Pierce was heavily involved in education. Sarah Pierce’s step-mother pushed all her children to pursue their education to the fullest extent. Sarah attended a dame school at the age of four or five, which led to her to admire many of her female teachers.     After the passing of her father in 1783, John Pierce Jr. was responsible for the family’s survival. With a step-mother and nine younger siblings, John needed assistance from his six younger sisters and pushed Sarah and another one of her sisters to study in New York City for a formal education. John hoped each sister could financially fend for themselves so he could concentrate more on his future and have the opportunity to establish a family of his own. Though John Pierce Jr. felt education was a necessity for his sisters, his views on the extent of education for a female was limited as he felt young women should only need “enough education to be pleasant and intelligent companions,” and he frequently asked his sisters not to read his books he left behind. Sarah felt quite the opposite about education, as she hoped, and eventually did, teach several different topics that were once looked at as subjects only men could learn.    Just as the Pierce family began to get financially stable, their family was struck by another devastating loss, as John Pierce Jr. died in 1788. He was only thirty five. Fortunately for the older women in the family, their education was either complete or nearing completion allowing them to either finding a suitor or teach. For two of Sarah’s sisters, they found happiness in marriage and began to raise a family of their own. For Sarah Pierce, this was never a desire. She was less inclined than her sisters to get married. She would rather spent her days being a role model to young girls and boys and by 1792 she had the formal education to do so. She began teaching girls and boys in her home, and by 1798 the school became so successful that an academy building was built. The Litchfield Female Academy thrived throughout the early 19th century, as thousands of girls and boys received a quality education not found in many other places across the country. Her nephew John Pierce Brace joined the Female Academy in 1814 as a teacher, and became the director in 1827. At that time Sarah stepped down as head of the school, but continued to teach, focusing on her favorite subject – history. Sarah Pierce died in Litchfield on January 19, 1852 and was buried in the West Burying Ground.  ",,1941-02-2.JPG,,"Pierce very frequently entertained Litchfield Law School students and supervised the social events. If displeased by a student's behavior, she would ban him from calling at the house. It was said that 'to be denied admission to Miss Sally Pierce's parlor was the deepest disgrace which could befall a young man.'

It is not clear if Dickinson received any formal training. As a young man he moved first to New Haven and later to New York City where he befriended contemporary painters and possibly improved his technique through their acquaintance.    Dickinson began painting around 1803. Unable to support himself in a single location, Dickinson traveled from town to town in search of commissions. He stopped in Litchfield numerous times on his trips up and down the east coast. He also traveled as far north as Canada and far south as Charleston, South Carolina.     Over his fifty year career Dickinson painted 1500 individuals. His sitters ranged from prominent members of Congress and state government officials to students attending the Litchfield Law School and Litchfield Female Academy.

He became a physician to the New York hospital in 1796, and the same year was a founder and editor of the ' Medical Repository.' During the yellow-fever epidemic in 1798 he was unremitting in his care of the sick, but finally contracted the disease, which proved fatal. He contributed to the 'Medical Repository' papers on pestilential fevers ; edited ' American Poems, Selected and Original ' (Litchfield, 1793) ; was the author of ' Letters to William Buel on the Fever which prevailed in New York in 1793 ' (1794); 'Edwin and Angelina,' an opera in three acts (1795); and prefixed to the American edition of Darwin's works an 'Epistle to the Author of the Botanic Garden' (1798).

Her parents were John Pierce and his second wife Mary Goodman Pierce. Mary's sister Sarah founded the Litchfield Female Academy in 1792. Although she never attended the Female Academy as a student, Mary assisted Sarah in running the school by managing the boarders who stayed in the Pierce house and keeping the financial records for the institution. Living her whole life in Litchfield, Mary died on June 22, 1863 and is buried in the East Cemetery.",,ca1890-12-2.jpg,,"Mary and her sister Sarah very frequently entertained Litchfield Law School students and Sarah supervised the social events. If displeased by a student's behavior, she would ban him from calling at the house. It was said that 'to be denied admission to Miss Sally Pierce's parlor was the deepest disgrace which could befall a young man.'",,,"Ca. 1815, Mary wrote Charles Loring about Anna Pierce Brace's fear for her heartbroken friend, James Johnston, a Litchfield Law School student. Johnston had been rebuffed by Litchfield Female Academy student Euphemia Blanch 'after having given him by the pleasure with which she received his attentions before his declaration great encouragement to be accepted.'     The rejection devastated Johnston who, according to Mary Pierce, was 'a foolish unprincipled youth' who 'threatened to kill himself.'     Johnston's classmates sat up with him all night to prevent his suicide and he left Litchfield the next morning. He then wrote his Litchfield friends, including Anna, 'frenzied letters.' He asked Anna to show the letter to Euphemia, 'thinking that if there were a spark of affection in her heart such extravagant attachment would awaken it, and move her to save him.'     Mary Pierce said Anna worried so much for Johnston that 'her cheeks grew pale, her appetite was entirely gone, and her nights sleepless.'     Charles Loring Collection, Litchfield Historical Society, ca. 1815/1816    On November 17, 1816, Mary wrote Charles G. Loring about 'Miss Amelia Peck,' “the young lady Mr. Davis was engaged to,” and “Mr. Davis [had] unkindly broken their long engagement.”     Pierce said Amelia was lovely in appearance, “but there is an indelicacy in her visiting at a Gentleman’s boardinghouse.”     Pierce deemed Davis “an excellent man” since “[a good son] resolves to comply with his father’s wishes and marry a lady of fortune in Delaware.

She was educated in private schools in New York and studied art with Robert Swain Gifford and William Sartain. She married John Aaron Vanderpoel on May 22, 1965. The couple had one son, John Arent Vanderpoel.    As a painter, Vanderpoel used primarily watercolor, but also painted with oils. Her work 'Ypres' was displayed at the National Museum in Washington, D.C. Several of her works are in the collection of the Litchfield Historical Society. Her books on art include <I>American Lace and Lace-Makers</I> and <I>Color Problems: A Practical Manual for the Lay Student of Color</I>. She was vice-president of the New York Watercolor Club and a member of the National Arts Club, the municipal Art Society, the Association of Women Painters and Sculptors.     An avid collector, Vanderpoel amassed a large collection of Japanese art which she donated to the Norwich museum, and a collection of art pottery which she donated to the Litchfield Historical Society.     Vanderpoel's interest in Litchfield came from her own heritage. She was the great-granddaughter of Benjamin Tallmadge, and purchased his home on North Street in Litchfield. She was an active member and first curator of the Litchfield Historical Society (then the Litchfield County Historical and Antiquarian Society). In that role, she collected the papers and artifacts of Litchfield during the early republic. She created the Society's shield, which served as its logo for many years, and was involved in its first incorporation in the 1890s. The Noyes Memorial Building, given by her son as a town library and room for the Historical Society, was completed after his death. Vanderpoel had a memorial stained glass window and a bronze tablet installed in his memory. She also funded the 1907 addition to the building. Perhaps her greatest contribution was her extensive research and devotion to documenting the students who attended the Litchfield Female Academy. She used the materials she collected in authoring a two volume history of the school, <I>Chronicles of a Pioneer School</I> and <I>More Chronicles of a Pioneer School</I>.     In 1899, a year after becoming a member, Vanderpoel helped organize a Litchfield chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, which was named for her great-grandmother Mary Floyd Tallmadge.

In 1776, he was given the same rank in the 5th cavalry with which he served in repelling Maj. Gen. William Tryon's raid on Danbury, Conn., and at the surrender of Gen. John Burgoyne in 1777. He also served as commissary of supplies at Litchfield, which was then a depot for military stores. In 1783, he retired with the rank of major.  <br> A Democrat-Republican, or Republican as they generally called themselves, he held the office of town clerk for 37 years from 1789 until his death, was elected annually to the legislature from 1795 to 1811, and was active in the affairs of the Episcopal church.

Webster grew up in an average colonial family - his father farmed and worked as a weaver, while his mother worked at home. At the time, few people went to college, but Webster enjoyed learning so much that his parents sent him to Yale, Connecticut’s first college. He left for New Haven in 1774 when he was 16 and graduated in 1778. He wanted to continue his education by studying law, but his parents could not afford to give him more money for school. After thinking about his options, Webster began working as a teacher. In 1789, Noah married Rebecca Greenleaf, the daughter of a rich man from Boston. During their long marriage, they had eight children and numerous grandchildren. The family lived in New Haven, and then moved to Amherst, Massachusetts. There, Webster helped to found Amherst College. The family later moved back to New Haven. In 1801, Webster started working on defining the words that Americans use. He did this because Americans spoke and used words differently than the English, and so people who lived in different parts of the country could speak and spell the same way.    In his dictionary, Webster used American spellings like “color” instead of the English “colour” and “music” instead of “musick”. He also added American words that weren’t in English dictionaries like “skunk” and “squash.” His first edition, A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language was published in 1806. This book offered brief definitions of about 37,000 words. It took him 22 more years to finish his American Dictionary of the English Language. When he finished in 1828, at the age of 70, Noah’s dictionary defined over 65,000 words.    Noah Webster accomplished many things in his life. Not only did he fight for an American language, he also fought for copyright laws, a strong federal government, universal education, and the abolition of slavery. In between fighting for these causes, he wrote textbooks, edited magazines, corresponded with men like George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, helped found Amherst College, raised eight children, and celebrated 54 anniversaries with his beloved wife.

She possessed good common sense united with sound discretion, mildness united with firmness, liberality without extravagance, the highest style of Christian character with the greatest humility. St. Michael’s Church has received many substantial marks of her liberality, the Episcopal parsonage was her gift, and every year she has contributed liberally to all the institutions of the church at large and the parish at home.

He was President of the AAAS in 1871. In 1859, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.    He was a pupil of John Torrey, with whom he worked closely; they published the Flora of North America together. The 'Elements of Botany' (1836), an introductory textbook, was the first of Gray's many works.    Gray traveled to the American west on two separate occasions, the first in 1872 and then again with Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1877. Both times his goal was botanical research: he avidly collected plant specimens to bring back with him to Harvard. On his second trip through the American west, he and Hooker reportedly collected over 1000 specimens. They were accompanied for a time by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden, then in charge of the U.S. Geological and Geophysical Survey of the Territories. Gray and Hooker's research was reported in their joint 1882 publication, 'The Vegetation of the Rocky Mountain Region and a Comparison with that of Other Parts of the World,' which appeared in volume six of Hayden's Bulletin of the United States Geological and Geophysical Survey of the Territories.    On both trips he climbed Grays Peak, one of Colorado's many fourteeners. This mountain was named after Gray by the botanist and explorer of the Rocky Mountains Charles Christopher Parry, who was likely a student of Gray's at Harvard.    Gray and Charles Darwin met at Kew, introduced by Joseph Dalton Hooker. Darwin then wrote to Gray requesting information about the distribution of various species of American flowers, which Gray provided, and which was helpful in providing information for the development of Darwin's theory. This was the beginning of an extensive lifelong correspondence. Gray arranged the first US Edition of On the Origin of Species and negotiated royalties on Darwin's behalf. Darwin held Gray in high esteem: he dedicated his book Forms of Flowers to Gray and he wrote in 1881 'there is hardly any one in the world whose approbation I value more highly than I do yours'    He died in 1888 and was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery. The cemetery's Asa Gray Garden, with a central fountain and numerous usual tree varieties, is named in his honor.",,,,,,,,,Educator,Cambridge/MA/United States,,,,,,

7298,Commodore Dudley Saltonstall,,Dudley Saltonstall,M,,New London,CT,United States ,1738,1796,,,,,,"Dudley Saltonstall was born in 1738 to Gurdon Saltonstall Jr and Mary Winthrop. Both sides of his family were prominent in British colonial politics; his great-grandfather on his father's side was Sir Richard Saltonstall, and his mother was descended from John Winthrop, who served as governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay in the 17th century. His father was a prominent figure in New London and Connecticut politics, serving as a probate judge and a leader of the community. In 1765 he married Frances Babcock, the daughter of Joshua Babcock, a doctor and lawyer who served on the supreme court of the Rhode Island Colony.  <br>Saltonstall took positions on the ships of the colonial mercantile fleet, and served as a merchant captain during the Seven Years' War. In April 1762 he was given command of a letter of marque brigantine, the Britannia, with which he made several successful voyages to the West Indies. During these years he established a reputation as a competent ship's captain.  <br>When the American Revolutionary War broke out, Saltonstall joined Connecticut's militia, helping to defend New London's harbor. When the Continental Navy was established, he was given one of the first captain's commissions, based on the recommendation of his brother-in-law Silas Deane, who served on Connecticut's Naval Committee. He was given command of the Alfred, the flagship of the new navy's commodore, Esek Hopkins. He hired John Paul Jones as his first lieutenant, and gave him the responsibility of overseeing the fitting out of the newly-acquired ship. He and Jones did not get along well, as Jones did not like Saltonstall's sometimes distant and superior demeanor.  <br>Saltonstall captained the Alfred on the Continental Navy's maiden voyage in March 1776, an expedition to Nassau in the Bahamas whose objective was arms and critically needed gunpowder. The expedition was somewhat successful, as Nassau was taken, but its governor had managed to remove much of the gunpowder before the takeover was completed. The return voyage was uneventful, although smallpox was spreading through the ships' crews, until the fleet neared Block Island. On April 4 and 5, the fleet captured British ships. On the morning of April 6, the HMS Glasgow was spotted, and was brought to action. In the ensuing battle, Alfred's steering controls were damaged by cannonfire, and she drifted out of the action. Glasgow was able to escape to Newport outrunning the heavily laden fleet.  <br>While the expedition was successful, Hopkins and Saltonstall were questioned over the fleet's failure to follow its stated orders, which had been to engage the British fleet off the Carolinas, and over its failure to capture the clearly outnumbered Glasgow. Saltonstall was not censured, but other captains in the fleet were punished for cowardly behavior.  <br>In September 1776 Saltonstall was given command of the Trumbull, which had been built at a dockyard on the Connecticut River. To Saltonstall's dismay, she was too heavily laden to cross the sand bar at the mouth of the river. After numerous repeated attempts to pass the bar in 1776 and 1777, the Marine Committee gave her command to Elisha Hinman, who successfully floated her into Long Island Sound in August 1779.  <br>Saltonstall's next command was the Warren, based in Boston. He replaced Hopkins at her helm in July 1779; Hopkins was suspended for breach of orders, and was eventually dismissed from the navy.  <br>In the summer of 1779, the British established a base in Penobscot Bay near present-day Castine, Maine, intended to be the beginning of a new province, New Ireland, and a stronghold for attacking American privateers operating against British shipping.  <br>The state of Massachusetts (which at that time included the District of Maine), organized an expedition to dislodge the British from this position. Saltonstall, the senior Continental Navy commander, was given command of the naval forces, which consisted primarily of ships from the Massachusetts State Navy, a large number of privateers, and a few Continental Navy ships, include the Warren. Command of the land forces accompanying the expedition was given to a relatively inexperienced Massachusetts militia brigadier general, Solomon Lovell.  <br>The unwieldy fleet had virtually no captains with experience in any sort of fleet operations, and many of them were used to the independence afforded by their privateering operations. While Saltonstall had participated in the Nassau expedition, he had only exercised command over his ship. Furthermore, the expedition was to be his maiden voyage aboard his new command. The expedition sailed for Penobscot Bay on July 19. When it arrived near the British base, commanders of the various forces met to consider their attack in a council that was later described by Paul Revere, the militia's artillery leader, as 'more like a meeting in a Coffee House than a council of War'.[1] Nothing of consequence was agreed, and the resultant lack of coordination between the various forces proved disastrous. Saltonstall and Lovell disagreed on tactics, and Saltonstall refused to take steps to engage the three British ships that were anchored near the fort in somewhat treacherous waters. He finally engaged Henry Mowat's small fleet at long range on June 29; his inexperienced gunnery crews did little damage, while Mowat's did significant damage to Warren and other ships. This made Saltonstall reluctant to order further engagements, including in support of land and amphibious operations. The arrival of a British relief fleet under Admiral George Collier at the mouth of the bay led to further strains. Saltonstall at first set up a line of defense against the arriving fleet, but when they began to close, he essentially ordered each ship to act independently, and the fleet organization dissolved. Most of the ships were eventually grounded and burned; some were captured after brief exchanges by the British. The land forces were essentially abandoned, and many men had to make lengthy overland treks back to civilization.  <br>Saltonstall's reported inaction and timidity were blamed for the failure of the expedition. Saltonstall was court-martialed in September 1779, found guilty, and eventually dismissed from military service  <br>Saltonstall returned to Connecticut, and convinced one of his wife's relatives, Adam Babcock, to support him in a privateering venture. As captain of the 16-gun brig Minerva, he embarked on a successful career as a privateer in 1781. Among his prizes was the richest captured by a Connecticut ship; the British ship Hannah was valued at £80,000.  <br>After the war, he engaged in trade with the West Indies, and also dabbled in the slave trade. He died in 1796 in the West Indies,apparently of a tropical disease.",,,,,,,,,Military,New London/CT/United States,,,,,,

7468,Aaron Ogden,,,M,,Elizabeth,NJ,,"December 3, 1756","April 19, 1839",,1784,,,,"Aaron Ogden was born and raised in Elizabethtown (now Elizabeth), New Jersey. He graduated from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1773. During the American Revolution, he served as an officer in the military, rising to brigade major. He also studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1784.    He later practiced law in his hometown even as he turned to politics. He served as presidential elector in 1796, as clerk of Essex County from 1785 to 1803, and was elected on the Federalist ticket to the United States Senate in 1801 after the serving New Jersey representative resigned. He ran unsuccessfully for re-election in 1802 and left the Senate in 1803.    In 1812, Ogden was elected as the eighth Governor of New Jersey and the next year turned down an offer from President James Madison to serve as a major general in the U.S. Army. After an unsuccessful re-election campaign, Ogden retired from politics and concentrated in stead on his legal career.    At this time, he became interested in and involved with the steamboat business. Indeed, he became embroiled in a landmark Supreme Court case in 1824. The state of New York had granted Ogden a monopoly on steamboat ferries between New Jersey and New York on the Hudson River. Another ferry, owned by a man named Gibbons, operated on this same route (he claimed the federal government had given him a monopoly) and Ogden sought an injunction against him. Eventually, Chief Justice John Marshall ruled in favor of Gibbons, finding that New York's monopoly was in violation of the Constitution which says, 'Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce ... among the several States.' This landmark case rapidly expanded the control Congress had over commercial activities and enabled it rapid growth in power throughout the next century. Marshall, a Federalist, believed that industry and commerce were the best path for the financial stability and growth of the United States.    Aaron Ogden married Elizabeth Chetwood. The couple had seven children, including Law School student Matthias Ogden and Female Academy student Amelia Ogden. Other children include Mary Chetwood Ogden, Phebe Ann Ogden, John Ogden, Elias B. D. Ogden, and two that died as small children.    Ogden died in April, 1839 and is interred in the First Presbyterian Church Burial Ground in Elizabeth, New Jersey.",,,"Biographical Directory of the United States Congress.

After completing his education in the common schools he was prepared for college by the Rev. George Beckwith, the Congregational minister of Litchfield South Farms. He then entered into his studies at Yale College, and graduated in 1786.  <br>After graduation Mr. Marsh went to Maryland and became a tutor and instructor at Cokesbury College near Baltimore, under the Rev. Levi Heath who gave him a full theological course of study at the same time. After his ordination Mr. Marsh also began assisting Mr. Heath in the parochial work of St. John’s parish in Baltimore. He desired to become a clergyman in his native state however, and when the parish of St. John’s in New Milford, Connecticut became vacant he gladly accepted the invitation in 1790 to become its rector.   <br>In 1799 Mr. Marsh left St. John’s to replace the Rev. David Butler at St. Michael’s in Litchfield. It was there that he spent the remainder of his life. When his health and endurance began to fail after 1810 he continued his work with assistants (among them were the Rev. Dr. Isaac Jones, the Rev. Dr. John S. Stone, and the Rev. William Lucas) until his resignation in 1830. After retiring as rector of St. Michael’s he remained in Litchfield to be the confidant and adviser to many of his former parishioners, the counselor and friends of his successors in the parish, and a respected senior among his brethren of the clergy.

Lucas and Anne (Sebin) Lucas. He was born in Pittsburgh, PA but his father soon relocated the family to St. Louis, MO. In 1806, Charles was sent east to Philadelphia for schooling. After he completed his education, he attended the Litchfield Law School.   <br>Lucas returned to St. Louis in 1811 and joined a territorial militia unit sent to patrol along the Illinois River. He subsequently transferred to a St. Louis volunteer artillery company led by his brother Robert. When Robert resigned his command in 1813, the St. Louis volunteers elected Charles to replace him. He was given the rank of Captain and for the duration of the War of 1812, the artillery company he commanded periodically reported for duty at the nearby military installation at Portage des Sioux.  <br> In 1814, Lucas was admitted to the territorial bar and that same year he won a seat in the territorial assembly as a representative from St. Louis County. Three years later President James Madison appointed him U.S. Attorney for the Missouri Territory. Lucas dabbled in land speculation and in 1816 he and Asa Morgan purchased a tract of land in present day Cooper County that they had chosen for a new town. They drew up plans and laid out a plat for Boonville, Missouri which they filed in 1817.  <br> The popular and well liked young Lucas soon found himself at odds with Thomas Hart Benton, another rising member of the St. Louis bar. Benton had allied himself with a political faction highly critical of Lucas' father who had become a staunch foe of the territory's Spanish land claimants. Charles Lucas and Benton first clashed publicly while representing opposing parties in a case argued in the St. Louis Circuit Court in October 1816. They exchanged insults in their closing statements and after losing the case Benton alleged that Lucas had defamed him. He demanded satisfaction in a duel but Lucas declined the challenge.  <br>Their paths crossed again on election day in August 1817 when Lucas questioned Benton's eligibility to vote on grounds that he had failed to pay his taxes. Benton's derisive dismissal of his detractor as a 'puppy' provoked Lucas to respond by demanding to settle the affront with a duel. Benton accepted, and they faced off on Bloody Island near St. Louis on August 12 using smoothbore pistols at a distance of thirty feet. Benton escaped from the encounter with a bruised knee but Lucas sustained more serious injuries from a bullet that cut an artery in his neck.  <br>Initially both men pronounced themselves satisfied. Benton subsequently reconsidered and demanded a second meeting after declaring that Lucas' friends had questioned his conduct in the affair. Their second meeting took place on September 27, 1817, and in that encounter Lucas died after a bullet hit near his heart.
