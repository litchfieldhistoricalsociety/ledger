John Allen only had a common education before attending Litchfield Law School and also worked as a teacher for several years.  As a minor, he taught younger children in a noted establishment in Germantown, PA. Allen then taught at New Milford, CT for six months.  He was admitted to the bar after attending LLS from 1784-86.  From 1793 to 1796, Allen represented Litchfield in the CT General Assembly.  In 1797, he was elected to the fifth U.S. Congress at the age of thirty-five.  However, Allen declined any further election to Congress after serving his first term.  In 1800, he was elected Assistant Judge to the CT Supreme Court of Errors and was subsequently reelected for the next five years.  His wife Ursula McCurdy was a graduate from the Litchfield Female Academy and the daughter of Lyne and Ursula McCurdy of Norwich, CT.  They had one son and one daughter.

He traveled to Vermont to meet her family with Sarah Pierce and a fellow teacher Louisa Wait.  He described Alinda's father as a \"drunken blacksmith\" but that her siblings had \"made themselves noted.\"  Alinda's brother Charles opposed the engagment and Alinda was forced to end the affair.  John was heartbroken and Alinda was sent to Montreal, Canada to visit her sister.  It was there that she met and married Mr. Whiteside in 1817 or 1818, as merchant for the Hudson Bay Company."

While Cornelia was at LFA she became involved with a student of the Law School whose last name was Rutledge. After setting a wedding date, problems emerged, and the engagement was broken.  Cornelia left Litchfield, and moved to Rhinebeck-on-Hudson, New York, where she lived with her aunt, Lydia Adams Cowles.  During her time there, she met and married a doctor, David Tomlinson of Derby, Connecticut. Throughout her life, Cornelia urged her female children and grandchildren to read frequently and to take their lessons seriously.  She loved discussing current events, and is has been recorded that two historians, Lossing and Dr. Francis, unsuccessfully urged her to write her memoirs of the United States’ early years as a republic. Cornelia and her husband David had eight chilren during their marriage. After Dr. Tomlinson passed away in 1840 she lived with her son Theodore until her death in April 1867.
